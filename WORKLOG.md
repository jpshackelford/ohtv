### 2026-05-26 19:58 UTC - OpenHands manual-test worker (PR #97)

**Ran manual blackbox tests for [PR #97](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/pull/97) (`feat: add fetch-loc command to backfill LOC from GitHub API (#80)`).**

- Test report posted: <https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/pull/97#issuecomment-4548205904>
- All 13 acceptance criteria from #80 verified via CLI (no Python-interpreter shortcuts).
- Real HTTP roundtrip against `jpshackelford/ohtv` PRs #95 (merged), #96 (merged), #97 (still open). LOC + `merged_at` written by `fetch-loc` matched `gh pr view` output exactly.
- Invariants verified under adversarial conditions: `HTTPS_PROXY=http://127.0.0.1:1` for "zero HTTP" cases (`--dry-run`, idempotent 2nd run), `grep -F "$GITHUB_TOKEN"` over stdout/stderr/`~/.ohtv/logs/ohtv.log` for "token never leaks".
- Migration 017 (`change_refs.status` CHECK widened to include `'open'`) confirmed at schema level on a fresh DB and exercised end-to-end (PR #97 ended with `status='open'`, no LOC numbers, AC #11 ✓).
- README's new `ohtv fetch-loc` section (commit `79b2c6d`) — all six documented examples are copy-pasteable; options table matches `--help` 1:1. No docs discrepancies.
- Full unit suite: **1577 passed** matching the PR body. `test_progress_lint.py` still green (the new module uses `make_progress(...)` from `ohtv.progress`).
- **Overall: Pass.** Ready for the next workflow gate (code review).

### 2026-05-26 16:00 UTC - OpenHands implementation worker (issue #89)

**Implemented [#89](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/issues/89) — `ohtv gen titles` auto-rename for placeholder-titled cloud conversations.** Draft PR opened, then promoted to ready: **[#96](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/pull/96)**.

- Cloud-source-only command with the placeholder regex `^Conversation [0-9a-f]{5,32}$` as the default selector; `--all-titled` overrides.
- Reuses the `gen objs` filter surface (`--day/--week/--since/--until/--pr/--repo/--label/-n/--all/--offset/--reverse`) plus title-specific flags (`--all-titled`, `--dry-run`, `--workers`, `--batch-size`, `--model`).
- Cache probe picks the best-available analysis variant (`detailed_assess > detailed > standard_assess > standard > brief_assess > brief`); cache-miss conversations are skipped before any LLM call.
- Batched LLM (default 25/chunk) with single-conv retry on chunk parse failure and a length re-prompt + hard-truncate fallback for overlong titles.
- Parallel PATCH via the new `CloudClient.update_conversation(id, *, title=...)`, routed through the existing `_request_with_retry` so `Retry-After` headers are honoured (default 5 workers, hard-capped at 50).
- Local writeback rewrites the manifest title in place (no `last_sync_at` advance) and calls `ConversationStore.update_metadata(id, title=...)` from PR #94 / Issue #86. **No widening** of the metadata column set — that's #87.
- Both progress bars (`Generating titles`, `Applying to cloud`) route through the `make_progress(...)` helper from PR #95; `tests/unit/test_progress_lint.py` continues to enforce this.
- Customizable prompt lives at `src/ohtv/prompts/titles/default.md` (user override at `~/.ohtv/prompts/titles/default.md`).
- **62 new tests** (45 unit + 9 integration-style + 7 cloud-client); full suite green: **1521 passed**.

Acceptance criteria from #89 all satisfied. Out-of-scope follow-ups (#87 column-set widening) explicitly NOT touched.

**Active Workers:**

| Conv ID | Type | Working On | Status |

| `5106f48` | implementation | Issue #89 — `gen titles` command | **NEW** (spawned 15:50Z, `execution_status: running`, `sandbox: RUNNING` confirmed) |

**Spawned: Implementation Worker (PR slot was empty after PR #95 merge; #91 dep landed; per acknowledged 10:50Z `## INSTRUCTION:` "handle #91 before #89, then resume normal routing")**

- Issue: [#89 — Add `gen titles` to auto-rename poorly-titled cloud conversations from cached gen objs analyses](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/issues/89) (priority:medium, expanded)
- Conversation: [`5106f489`](https://app.all-hands.dev/conversations/5106f48953a74388b291f9bcbbc0c79d) (`selected_repository=jpshackelford/ohtv`)
- Start task: `d915fdb4d22a4410ad3ab5d2b952bc0c` → `READY` on first 6s poll → `app_conversation_id=5106f48953a74388b291f9bcbbc0c79d`. Verified `GET /app-conversations?ids=…` returns `execution_status: running`, `sandbox_status: RUNNING`.
- Plugin loaded: `github:jpshackelford/.openhands/plugins/ohtv-workflow@feat/ohtv-workflow-plugin`.
- Model: `litellm_proxy/claude-opus-4-7`.

**Why now (decision-tree gates):**

- ✅ **PR #95 merged:** `state: MERGED`, `mergedAt: 2026-05-26T15:23:16Z`, squash commit `c594d923ed86778bd04c89aa47de8ea33db62417`. Verified on `main`: `git log --oneline -1` → `c594d92 feat: standardize progress bars via shared make_progress helper (#91)`.
- ✅ **Issue #91 closed:** `state: CLOSED`, `closedAt: 2026-05-26T15:23:18Z` (auto-closed by `Closes #91` in PR description).
- ✅ **No open PRs:** `gh pr list --state open` → `[]`. PR slot empty.
- ✅ **Prior PR worker `ff08a0b` (merge for PR #95) cleanly disposed:** `execution_status: null`, `sandbox: PAUSED`, `updated_at: 15:23:09Z`, `accumulated_cost: $2.35` over 2.5M prompt tokens. Did exactly its scope.
- ✅ **#89 is the next routed item per the acknowledged 10:50Z `## INSTRUCTION:`** ("handle #91 before #89, then resume normal routing"). Hard dep #91 is now satisfied.
- ✅ **No competing ohtv workers:** `ohtv list --repo ohtv --since 4h --idle 15` shows all 6 recent cloud conversations green (≥26m idle); the running `5106f48` is the one I just spawned.
- ✅ **No competing orchestrator cycle:** Only other non-ohtv `RUNNING` conversation is `8ef326a3` (no `selected_repository`, just-spawned, likely this orchestrator cycle itself).

**Implementation worker scope (prompt highlights):**

- Verify `main` includes commit `c594d923…` (the `make_progress` helper) before branching.
- Read issue #89 body + comments — they specify the full pipeline: placeholder selector (regex `^Conversation [0-9a-f]{5,32}$` by default, `--all-titled` override), reuse of `gen objs` flag surface (`--day/--week/--since/--until/--pr/--repo/--label/-n/--all/--offset/--reverse`), plus new flags `--dry-run/--workers/--batch-size/--model`.
- Pipeline: probe cache (detailed > standard > brief variant) → batch LLM `[{id, description}] → [{id, title}]` (chunk default 25, single-conv retry on parse failure) → parallel PATCH `/app-conversations/{id}` via `parallel.run_parallel` with progress bar → local writeback via `ConversationStore.update_metadata(conv_id, title=...)` (from #86 — do NOT widen its column set, that's #87) + in-place manifest title rewrite (do NOT advance `last_sync_at`).
- **Progress bars MUST use the new `make_progress(verb=..., show_rate=True, show_remaining=True, show_eta=True)` helper from PR #95** — the lint guard from #91 will fail CI otherwise.
- Add a customizable prompt template under `src/ohtv/prompts/titles.md` (follows existing `prompts/*.md` convention; reuse the `ohtv/prompts/__init__.py` loader).
- Title constraints (LLM-prompt enforced): ≤50 chars including optional leading emoji, imperative Title Case phrase, no trailing punctuation.
- Cloud-source only: local CLI conversations silently skipped with a single end-of-run note.
- Tests: placeholder regex selector, LLM-response parser (incl. parse-failure → single-conv retry), `update_metadata` writeback (no network — patch CloudClient PATCH), `--dry-run` produces no PATCH calls and no DB writes. Target >80% coverage on new code.
- Branch `feat/gen-titles-89`; PR title `feat: add gen titles to auto-rename placeholder-titled cloud conversations (#89)`; body must include `Closes #89`.
- Open as DRAFT, monitor CI green, then move to ready (triggers review bot). Exit after that — docs/testing/review/merge are separate orchestrator-spawned conversations.
- Explicit DO-NOTs: widening `update_metadata` column set (that's #87), unrelated refactors, running test/review/merge phases inline.

**Prior worker disposition (sweep):**

- `ff08a0b` (merge, PR #95) — `execution_status: null`, `sandbox: PAUSED` at 15:23:09Z. PR #95 merged at 15:23:16Z; issue #91 closed at 15:23:18Z. Cleanly executed scope.
- `857518e` (review, PR #95) — `sandbox: PAUSED` since 14:52Z. No longer relevant.
- `c493bbf`, `bba7f97`, `e10e07*`, `a119ddf` — all `sandbox: PAUSED`, not consuming slots.

**PR slot:** Now occupied by `5106f489` (impl on #89).
**Expansion slot:** Idle — all 8 remaining open `ready` issues are already expanded; no `needs-info` / `needs-split`; no unlabeled issues. Per `gh issue list --state open --json labels --jq '[.[] | select(.labels | map(.name) | (contains(["ready"]) or contains(["hold"])) | not)]'` → `[]`. Nothing to expand.

**Current State (verified 15:45–15:50Z):**

- **Open PRs:** 0 (PR #95 merged; no successor PR yet — `5106f489` will open one).
- **Ready issues (8, all expanded):** `priority:medium`: #80, #81, #83, **#89 (now being implemented)**, #90, #92; `priority:low`: #82, #87.
- **Closed in this cycle:** #91 (auto-closed by PR #95 merge).
- **Needs expansion:** 0. **On hold:** #26 (`hold` label). **Blocked / needs-info / needs-split:** none.
- **Other running OH conversations (non-ohtv):** `8ef326a3` (no `selected_repository`, just spawned — this orchestrator cycle itself). No competing orchestrator.

**Housekeeping:** WORKLOG.md was at 520 lines pre-cycle (this entry pushes it past 580). The skill's >300-line threshold is well exceeded. However, the 6-hour productive-work preservation window currently spans ~09:50Z–15:50Z, which captures every entry currently in the file (oldest non-archive entry is the 10:50Z `## INSTRUCTION:` at line 3). Truncation right now would not remove anything. **Deferring archive to the next cycle** — by then the 10:50Z instruction, 11:19Z PR #94 merge, and 12:21Z–13:21Z impl/spawn entries for #91 will all be past the 6-hour window and can be safely archived, while the 14:21Z+ test/review/merge chain for #95 and today's 15:50Z spawn for #89 stay preserved.

**Auto-disable check:** Not applicable — this cycle spawned a worker (productive). Two-quiet-period counter remains at 0.

**Next check (~30 min):**

- If `5106f489` is `running` → log status, do nothing. Implementation typically takes 20-60 min depending on test scaffolding work.
- If `5106f489` is `finished` AND `gh pr list --state open` shows 1 PR → check whether it's DRAFT or READY:
  - DRAFT with green CI → likely worker exited before promoting; spawn a small **finish-up worker** to flip to ready (or treat as the impl worker still needing to mark ready).
  - READY with green CI and `## Manual Test Results` absent → spawn **docs worker** first if README needs updating (new CLI command `gen titles` → docs update is **required** per the workflow's docs-before-test rule). After docs, spawn **testing worker**.
  - READY with green CI and docs already updated → spawn **testing worker**.
- If `5106f489` is `finished` AND no PR was opened → investigate the conversation's last events; likely the worker was blocked. May need a `## INSTRUCTION:` from the human.
- If a new `## INSTRUCTION:` entry appears in WORKLOG.md → follow it first.
- Truncation candidate: once #89's PR enters review (probably 2-3 cycles from now), archive entries ≤14:20Z.

**Spawned: Documentation Worker (PR slot was empty after impl worker `5106f489` finished and opened PR #96; README not yet updated for a brand-new user-facing CLI subcommand)**

- PR: [#96 — `feat: add gen titles to auto-rename placeholder-titled cloud conversations (#89)`](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/pull/96)
- Conversation: [`dd70b780`](https://app.all-hands.dev/conversations/dd70b7809c73438a96ffb3401f76f8cb) (`selected_repository=jpshackelford/ohtv`, `pr_number=[96]`)
- Start task: `294b8299` → `STARTING_CONVERSATION` on first 6s poll → `READY` on second poll → `app_conversation_id=dd70b7809c73438a96ffb3401f76f8cb`. Verified `GET /app-conversations?ids=…` returns `execution_status: running`, `sandbox_status: RUNNING`.
- Plugin loaded: `github:jpshackelford/.openhands/plugins/ohtv-workflow@feat/ohtv-workflow-plugin`.
- Model: `litellm_proxy/claude-opus-4-7`.

**Why docs (not testing) — decision-tree gates:**

- ✅ **PR #96 opened by `5106f489` at 16:10:32Z**, branch `feat/gen-titles-89`, head `394fd635`, base `main`. 2625+/0− across 9 files: `src/ohtv/cli.py` (new `gen titles` subcommand), `src/ohtv/analysis/titles.py` (new module — 1 file), `src/ohtv/prompts/titles/default.md` (new prompt template), `src/ohtv/sources/cloud.py` (cloud PATCH support), `src/ohtv/analysis/__init__.py`, plus 3 test files and `AGENTS.md` updates.
- ✅ **PR is READY** (not draft), **`MERGEABLE`/CLEAN**, `reviewDecision: ""` (no review submitted yet), 0 review threads (pr-review bot left no inline comments — left an overall approval-shaped review).
- ✅ **CI green:** 1 check (`PR Review by OpenHands/pr-review`) → `SUCCESS` in 3m58s. No other CI gates configured on this branch.
- ❌ **README.md NOT in diff** — confirmed via `gh pr diff 96 --name-only | grep -i readme` → empty. Yet the PR introduces a brand-new top-level CLI subcommand (`ohtv gen titles`) with: (a) the placeholder-detection selector + `--all-titled` override; (b) the entire `gen objs` selector flag surface re-exposed; (c) four genuinely new flags `--dry-run`, `--workers`, `--batch-size`, `--model`; (d) a new prompt template under `src/ohtv/prompts/titles/default.md` reachable via the existing `ohtv prompts` machinery. Every one of those is on the workflow's "docs update REQUIRED" list (new CLI commands / new flags / new configuration / new env-derived defaults).
- ❌ **No manual test results** — `gh pr view 96 --comments` returns zero comments. Testing has not started.
- Per the explicit workflow rule: *"Documentation must be updated BEFORE testing"* — so docs is the correct next slot.

**Docs worker scope (prompt highlights):**

- Clone, checkout `feat/gen-titles-89`, `uv sync`.
- Read PR diff + `cli.py` + `analysis/titles.py` + `gen titles --help` to document **what was built** (not just what the issue spec'd).
- Update README.md adjacent to the existing `gen objs` section. Required coverage: synopsis, `gen objs` prerequisite, selector behavior (`^Conversation [0-9a-f]{5,32}$` default + `--all-titled`), shared selector flags (`--day/--week/--since/--until/--pr/--repo/--label/-n/--all/--offset/--reverse`), new flags (`--dry-run`, `--workers`, `--batch-size`, `--model`), cloud-source-only scope, ≥2 copy-pasteable examples, and prompt-customization pointer (`src/ohtv/prompts/titles/default.md` + `ohtv prompts`).
- Single commit `docs: document gen titles command in README`. Push and watch CI. Post one PR comment summarizing the docs update.
- Explicit DO-NOTs: no source file edits beyond `README.md` (except `--help` typo fixes if they block accurate docs), no WORKLOG edits, no draft toggle, no testing/merge work, no spawning sub-conversations.

**Prior worker disposition (sweep):**

- `5106f489` (impl, #89) — `execution_status: finished` at 16:11:59Z, `sandbox: RUNNING` (sandbox idle, not consuming a slot). `accumulated_cost: $20.19` over 31.9M prompt tokens (31.5M from cache). Cleanly executed scope: branched `feat/gen-titles-89`, implemented `gen titles` with placeholder selector + LLM batch + parallel PATCH + writeback, added prompt template, 3 test files, opened PR #96 in READY state with green CI. The 0-line README delta is the gap this orchestrator cycle is filling.
- `ff08a0b1`, `857518e`, `c493bbf`, `bba7f97`, `e10e07*`, `a119ddf` — all `sandbox: PAUSED`, not consuming slots. PR #94/#95 chain is fully landed (both merged).
- No other `running` conversations with `selected_repository=jpshackelford/ohtv`. Only competing `running` conversation network-wide is `66669ba2` (no repo, no PR — this orchestrator cycle itself).

**PR slot:** Now occupied by `dd70b780` (docs on PR #96).
**Expansion slot:** Idle — all 8 remaining open `ready` issues are already expanded; `gh issue list --jq '[.[] | select(.labels|map(.name)|(contains(["ready"]) or contains(["hold"]))|not)]'` → `[]`. Nothing to expand.

**Current State (verified 16:14–16:21Z):**

- **Open PRs:** 1 — PR #96 (READY, `MERGEABLE`/CLEAN, head `394fd635`, 1/1 CI ✓, 0 review threads, 0 comments).
- **Ready issues (8, all expanded):** `priority:medium`: #80, #81, #83, #90, #92; `priority:low`: #82, #87. (#89 is now in-flight via PR #96; will be closed by `Closes #89` in the PR body on merge.)
- **Needs expansion:** 0. **On hold:** #26. **Blocked / needs-info / needs-split:** none.

**Sync note:** `ohtv sync` failed this cycle with HTTP 401 (cloud auth). The `OH_API_KEY` env var is present but the value doesn't authenticate against the cloud sync endpoint. This is the same auth class the 2026-05-22 11:50Z `## INSTRUCTION:` flagged, though that one was marked resolved by 10:50Z today; the resolution may have only covered the writer side or has since regressed. **Not blocking:** all orchestration decisions this cycle were driven by GitHub API + OH cloud API directly (both green); `ohtv list` was not required because WORKLOG already names the right conv IDs. If this recurs over multiple cycles, the human may want to file a follow-up.

**Housekeeping:** WORKLOG.md was at 610 lines pre-cycle (this entry pushes it past 690). The skill's >300-line threshold is well exceeded, but the 6-hour productive-work preservation window (currently ~10:21Z–16:21Z) still covers every entry in the file — the oldest preserved entry is the 10:50Z `## INSTRUCTION:` (5h 31m old). The 11:19/11:21Z PR #94 entries are 5h 02m old and will exit the window in ~1 hour. **Truncation deferred one more cycle** — the next orchestrator wake-up (~16:51Z if cron) or (~17:21Z if natural rhythm) will be able to safely archive everything ≤11:21Z while preserving the 12:21Z+ PR #95 impl/test/review/merge chain plus today's #89 impl/docs/test/review/merge chain.

**Auto-disable check:** Not applicable — this cycle spawned a worker (productive). Two-quiet-period counter remains at 0.

**Next check (~30 min):**

- If `dd70b780` is `running` → log status, do nothing. Docs work is typically 5–15 min including the CI wait.
- If `dd70b780` is `finished` AND PR #96 has a new commit prefixed `docs:` AND a `## Documentation updated` comment AND CI is green → spawn **testing worker** for PR #96. The test plan should cover: `gen titles --dry-run` (no PATCH attempts, no DB writes), placeholder-regex selector behavior (vs `--all-titled`), batch-size + workers parallelism, prompt loader fallback to user override under `~/.ohtv/prompts/titles/`, and at least one live `gen titles -n 1` end-to-end run if cloud auth is working (else note as skipped due to the sync auth issue above).
- If `dd70b780` is `finished` AND no docs commit appeared → investigate the conversation events; may need a re-spawn with adjusted scope or a `## INSTRUCTION:` from the human.
- If `dd70b780` pushed code beyond README — flag as scope violation. The prompt allowed `--help`-string typo fixes only, called out as a separate commit. Anything more is a violation and the worker should be re-prompted (or replaced).
- If new commits land on PR #96 after the docs commit (e.g., automated review bot kicks again) and they're substantive → testing must come before review per the docs-before-test rule already satisfied; re-test heuristic will determine if re-test is needed once tests exist.
- If a new `## INSTRUCTION:` entry appears in WORKLOG.md → follow it first.
- **Truncation candidate next cycle:** archive entries ≤11:21Z once they exit the 6h productive-work window.

### 2026-05-26 16:50 UTC - Orchestrator

**Active Workers:**

| Conv ID | Type | Working On | Status |
|---------|------|------------|--------|
| `5dc3a67` | testing | PR #96 — `gen titles` (#89) | **NEW** (spawned 16:50Z, `execution_status: running`, `sandbox: RUNNING` confirmed) |

**Spawned: Testing Worker (PR slot was empty after docs worker `dd70b780` finished; README updated; no manual test results yet)**

- PR: [#96 — `feat: add gen titles to auto-rename placeholder-titled cloud conversations (#89)`](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/pull/96)
- Conversation: [`5dc3a672`](https://app.all-hands.dev/conversations/5dc3a6723c9d48f89df35b07b5c69850) (`selected_repository=jpshackelford/ohtv`, `pr_number=[96]`)
- Start task: `c0cb8c0f` → `READY` on first 6s poll → `app_conversation_id=5dc3a6723c9d48f89df35b07b5c69850`. Verified `GET /app-conversations?ids=…` returns `execution_status: running`, `sandbox_status: RUNNING`.
- Plugin loaded: `github:jpshackelford/.openhands/plugins/ohtv-workflow@feat/ohtv-workflow-plugin`.

**Why testing — decision-tree gates:**

- ✅ **Prior docs worker `dd70b780` finished cleanly:** `execution_status: null`, `sandbox: PAUSED` at 16:27:38Z, `accumulated_cost: $3.80`. Pushed commit `066ba27e docs: document gen titles command in README` at 16:25:26Z and posted the structured `## Documentation updated` comment.
- ✅ **README.md now in diff:** `gh pr diff 96 --name-only | grep -i readme` → `README.md` present. Confirmed by inspecting the comment: new `#### ohtv gen titles` section between `gen objs` and `gen run`, full flag table, ≥8 copy-pasteable examples, prompt-customization pointer to `src/ohtv/prompts/titles/default.md` + `ohtv prompts` machinery.
- ✅ **PR is READY + MERGEABLE/CLEAN:** `isDraft: false`, `mergeable: MERGEABLE`, `mergeStateStatus: CLEAN`, head `066ba27ed1c4a59ea069f4c28d0eeeea2b582795`.
- ✅ **CI green:** `gh pr checks 96` → "no checks reported on the 'feat/gen-titles-89' branch" for the latest commit. The project's only configured check is the OpenHands pr-review bot, which ran on the initial commit `394fd635` with `SUCCESS` (3m58s) and didn't re-trigger on the README-only commit — that's expected behavior and not a regression. No failing checks anywhere.
- ✅ **No manual test results yet:** `gh pr view 96 --comments` shows exactly two comments: (a) the pr-review bot's "🟢 Good taste" approval-shaped review on the initial commit, (b) the docs worker's "## Documentation updated" comment. **Zero comments matching `## Manual Test Results`.**
- ✅ **0 review threads:** GraphQL `reviewThreads(first:20).nodes | length` → 0. The pr-review bot left an overall review, not inline threads, so the workflow's "💬 > 0 → review worker" gate is NOT triggered. Testing is correctly first.
- ✅ **Per the docs-before-test rule:** docs are now updated, so testing is the correct next slot.

**Testing worker scope (prompt highlights):**

- Clone + checkout `feat/gen-titles-89` + `uv sync`. Read README's new `gen titles` section to understand documented behavior, then verify each documented behavior maps to actual behavior.
- 10 test groups: (1) help + discoverability, (2) `--dry-run` safety — must issue ZERO PATCH calls and ZERO DB writes, (3) placeholder selector default `^Conversation [0-9a-f]{5,32}$` vs `--all-titled` override, (4) shared `gen objs` filter surface (`-n/--day/--week/--since/--until/-D/-W/--pr/--repo/--label/--reverse/--offset/-A`), (5) title-specific flags (`--workers` default 5 / cap 50, `--batch-size` default 25, `--model`/`-m`), (6) cache-probe order (`detailed_assess > detailed > standard_assess > standard > brief_assess > brief`), (7) cloud-source-only scoping (local CLI convs silently skipped), (8) one live end-to-end `gen titles -n 1` if cloud auth works — else document the 401 and mark SKIPPED (the 16:21Z entry flagged cloud sync auth may still be intermittently failing), (9) `uv run pytest -x` full suite + new tests in `tests/unit/analysis/test_titles.py`, (10) `make_progress` integration sanity (the #91 lint guard should already enforce, but visual confirmation).
- Post ONE PR comment with header `## Manual Test Results` (so orchestrator can detect it), structured per `/manual-test` skill. Include env (Python, OS, HEAD SHA), per-test PASS/FAIL/SKIP + one-line evidence, overall 🟢/🟡/🔴 verdict, and notable observations.
- Explicit DO-NOTs: no commits to the PR branch (bugs → document in test report only); ONE comment, not multiple; no continue-to-review or merge after testing; no WORKLOG edits; no PR draft toggle.

**Prior worker disposition (sweep):**

- `dd70b780` (docs, PR #96) — `execution_status: null`, `sandbox: PAUSED` at 16:27:38Z. Cleanly executed scope (one `docs:` commit + one structured comment). $3.80 / 5.2M prompt tokens (5.0M from cache).
- `5106f489` (impl, PR #96) — `sandbox: RUNNING` but no longer doing work; finished at 16:11:59Z. Not consuming a slot.
- `ff08a0b1`, `857518e`, `c493bbf`, `bba7f97`, `e10e07*`, `a119ddf`, `3f5aacd`, `6b3c4c9` — all `sandbox: PAUSED`, not consuming slots.
- Network-wide running conversations with `selected_repository=jpshackelford/ohtv`: just the new `5dc3a672`. Other `running` conversations (`97d22c23`, `e9991329`, `5a643628`, `07663402`) have no `selected_repository` or are unrelated (Helm docs, skills repo) — not competing.

**PR slot:** Now occupied by `5dc3a672` (testing on PR #96).
**Expansion slot:** Idle — `gh issue list --jq '[.[] | select(.labels|map(.name)|(contains(["ready"]) or contains(["hold"]))|not)]'` → `[]`. All ready issues have priorities already. Nothing to expand or re-prioritize.

**Current State (verified 16:46–16:50Z):**

- **Open PRs:** 1 — PR #96 (READY, MERGEABLE/CLEAN, head `066ba27e`, README in diff, docs comment posted, 0 review threads, 0 manual test results — now being tested).
- **Ready issues (7 remaining after #89 lands, all expanded):** `priority:medium`: #80, #81, #83, #90, #92; `priority:low`: #82, #87.
- **In-flight:** #89 via PR #96 (will close on merge via `Closes #89`).
- **Needs expansion:** 0. **On hold:** #26. **Blocked / needs-info / needs-split:** none.

**Sync note:** `ohtv sync` succeeded this cycle (exit 0, no output) using `OPENHANDS_API_KEY` — last cycle's HTTP 401 was either resolved or specific to that worker's auth path. Will continue to monitor; not yet blocking anything.

**Housekeeping:** WORKLOG.md was at 677 lines pre-cycle (this entry pushes it past 750). The skill's >300-line threshold is well exceeded. However, the 6-hour productive-work preservation window (currently ~10:50Z–16:50Z) STILL just barely captures the oldest preserved entry (the 10:50Z `## INSTRUCTION:` — exactly on the boundary at 6h 00m, plus the 11:19/11:21Z PR #94 entries at 5h 31m). **Truncation deferred one more cycle** — by the next orchestrator wake-up (~17:20Z if cron), the 10:50Z instruction and 11:19/11:21Z PR #94 chain will all be safely past the 6h boundary and can be archived together (saving ~150 lines). Today's 12:21Z–16:50Z PR #95 + PR #96 productive chain stays preserved.

**Auto-disable check:** Not applicable — this cycle spawned a worker (productive). Two-quiet-period counter remains at 0.

**Next check (~30 min):**

- If `5dc3a672` is `running` → log status, do nothing. Manual testing typically takes 15–40 min including the unit-test run.
- If `5dc3a672` is `finished` AND a `## Manual Test Results` comment is on PR #96:
  - **🟢 GREEN verdict + 0 review threads + 0 new commits** → spawn **merge worker** (CI green, docs updated, tests pass, no review feedback to address; pr-review bot already approved).
  - **🟢 GREEN verdict + ≥1 review threads** → spawn **review worker** to address inline feedback first.
  - **🟡 YELLOW verdict** → spawn **review worker** with the test caveats as context; reviewer decides whether to fix.
  - **🔴 RED verdict** → spawn **review worker** (or fix-up worker) with the failing-test details; will need re-test cycle.
- If `5dc3a672` is `finished` AND no `## Manual Test Results` comment → investigate the conversation events; may need re-spawn with adjusted scope or human `## INSTRUCTION:`.
- If `5dc3a672` pushed code to the PR branch — flag as scope violation; reset and re-spawn cleanly.
- If a new `## INSTRUCTION:` entry appears in WORKLOG.md → follow it first.
- **Truncation candidate next cycle:** archive entries ≤11:21Z (10:50Z `INSTRUCTION` + 11:19/11:21Z PR #94 merge chain) once they exit the 6h productive-work window.

### 2026-05-26 17:30 UTC - Orchestrator

**Active Workers:**

| Conv ID | Type | Working On | Status |
|---------|------|------------|--------|
| `e009b92` | review | PR [#96](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/pull/96) — gen titles (#89) | **NEW** |

**Spawned: Review Worker**
- Conversation: [`e009b92`](https://app.all-hands.dev/conversations/e009b928669a4c35a95464741ef39142)
- Branch: `feat/gen-titles-89`
- Trigger: 🟡 YELLOW manual-test verdict on PR #96 (testing worker `5dc3a67` reported two 🔴 blockers).

**Round 1 scope (passed to worker):**
1. **Manifest writeback ID-normalization bug** in `src/ohtv/cli.py:_apply_local_title_writeback` — `CloudConversation.id` is dashed, sync manifest is keyed without dashes, so `manifest.conversations.get(conv_id)` silently misses. Fix: strip dashes at the lookup site + surface a `Manifest updated: N/M` row in both live and dry-run summaries (so this class of bug can't hide again). New unit test against `_apply_local_title_writeback` with a dashed id.
2. **`ohtv prompts show titles/default` is broken** — `prompts show` (`cli.py:7653-7670`) resolves only against legacy flat `PROMPT_NAMES`; `prompts reset` (just below) already handles `family/variant` paths. Fix the asymmetry by lifting/sharing the resolver. New unit test calling `prompts show titles/default`.
3. **Explicitly deferred** (worker told to note as out-of-scope): `--model haiku` shorthand suggestion, 429 rate-limit handling improvement, `local_skipped` test-coverage gap.
4. **Explicitly forbidden**: do not widen `ConversationStore.update_metadata` column set (still #87), do not advance `last_sync_at`, do not edit `WORKLOG.md`, do not push to `main`, do not mark review threads resolved (there are none).
5. Worker must: undo-ready → fix → `uv run python -m pytest tests/ -q` (must stay green; was 1521 pre-fix, expect 1523+) → push → reply to manual-test comment with commit SHAs → `gh pr ready 96` → EXIT.

**Current State:**
- [PR #96](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/pull/96): OPEN, MERGEABLE, CLEAN, ready → will be flipped back to draft by the review worker.
- No other open PRs.
- Ready issues queue (not picked this cycle — PR slot occupied): #80 (GitHub API LOC fetching), #81 (velocity report command), plus others.
- Expansion slot: idle (nothing flagged as needing expansion this cycle; not gathered exhaustively given the rate-limit budget burn from this wake-up).

**Housekeeping:**
- WORKLOG.md was 748 lines → archived 10:50Z / 11:19Z / 11:21Z entries (all >6h old) into `WORKLOG_ARCHIVE_2026-05-26.md`. Current size: ~620 lines.

**Notes:**
- Hit OpenHands API rate limit (HTTP 429: 100/min) several times this cycle — burned by prior poll-heavy testing-worker handoff. Waited 3 min before spawning succeeded. Worth keeping an eye on; if it recurs the polling pattern in the spawn flow should be made less chatty.
- Next check on next cron trigger (~30 min). Expected state then: review worker `e009b92` finished, PR #96 ready for re-test (testing slot, fresh testing worker).

### 2026-05-26 17:49 UTC - Orchestrator

**Active Workers:**

| Conv ID | Type | Working On | Status |
|---------|------|------------|--------|
| `8750de9` | re-testing | PR [#96](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/pull/96) — `gen titles` (#89) after review round 1 | **NEW** (spawned 17:49Z, `execution_status: running`, `sandbox: RUNNING`) |

**Spawned: Re-Testing Worker (PR slot was empty after review worker `e009b928` finished)**

- PR: [#96 — `feat: add gen titles to auto-rename placeholder-titled cloud conversations (#89)`](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/pull/96)
- Conversation: [`8750de99`](https://app.all-hands.dev/conversations/8750de999ad3418b84bf2a2933c1ac5f) (`selected_repository=jpshackelford/ohtv`, `pr_number=[96]`)
- Start task: `8e81ec5c` → `STARTING_CONVERSATION` on first 5s poll → `READY` on second poll → `app_conversation_id=8750de999ad3418b84bf2a2933c1ac5f`, `sandbox=CRB8IHZjon6DZLxoFpDlf`. Verified `GET /app-conversations?ids=…` returns `execution_status: running`, `sandbox_status: RUNNING`.
- Plugin loaded: `github:jpshackelford/.openhands/plugins/ohtv-workflow@feat/ohtv-workflow-plugin`.

**Why re-testing — decision-tree gates:**

- ✅ **Prior review worker `e009b928` finished cleanly:** `execution_status: finished`, last update 17:40:16Z. Pushed two fix commits and posted a structured `## Review round 1 — fixes for manual-test findings` reply on the manual-test comment with explicit blocker → commit-SHA mapping.
- ✅ **PR is READY + MERGEABLE/CLEAN:** `isDraft: false`, `state: OPEN`, `mergeable: MERGEABLE`, `mergeStateStatus: CLEAN`, head `5b1f33a2e4a4ed6ff06f583981314bb568823fb1`. The review worker correctly flipped back to ready after fixes.
- ✅ **CI green:** `gh pr checks 96` → "All checks were successful" (1 successful: `PR Review by OpenHands/pr-review` in 3m46s on the README commit; the project's pr-review bot is the only configured check and does not re-trigger on every commit — expected behavior, not a regression).
- ✅ **0 review threads:** GraphQL `reviewThreads(first:20).nodes | length` → 0. Review worker addressed the manual-test report via reply comment, not inline threads (there were no inline threads from the testing worker either).
- ✅ **Test results outdated (re-test heuristic):** Last manual test ran on `066ba27e` (16:25Z). HEAD is now `5b1f33a2` (17:38Z). Two non-test source commits landed in between:
  - `6969e959 fix(prompts): teach 'prompts show' to accept family/variant paths` — touches `src/ohtv/cli.py`
  - `5b1f33a2 fix(gen-titles): normalize dashed conv ids in manifest writeback` — touches `src/ohtv/cli.py` (and likely `src/ohtv/analysis/titles.py` / `src/ohtv/sources/cloud.py` per the PR's changed-files list)
  
  Files in PR (sanity check): `src/ohtv/cli.py`, `src/ohtv/analysis/titles.py`, `src/ohtv/sources/cloud.py`, `src/ohtv/analysis/__init__.py`, `src/ohtv/prompts/titles/default.md` (non-test source), plus README/AGENTS/tests. **Re-test required** per the heuristic ("non-test `.py` files changed since last test").

**Re-testing worker scope (prompt highlights):**

- Clone + checkout `feat/gen-titles-89` at `5b1f33a2` + `uv sync`. Read `066ba27e..5b1f33a2` diff for exactly what changed since the last test.
- Read both the original `## Manual Test Results` (17:12Z, on `066ba27e`) and the review worker's `## Review round 1 — fixes for manual-test findings` reply to anchor on the two blockers.
- **Both blockers must be re-verified end-to-end (not just trust the unit tests):**
  - **Blocker a (manifest ID-normalization):** Construct dashed-id scenario; verify `_apply_local_title_writeback` finds manifest entry; verify `Manifest updated: N/M` row appears in BOTH live and dry-run summaries; confirm `tests/unit/test_cli_gen_titles.py` covers dashed-id case.
  - **Blocker b (`prompts show` family/variant):** Run `ohtv prompts show titles/default` (must succeed and print body); verify legacy flat-name path still works (asymmetry was fixed by lifting/sharing the resolver); confirm `tests/unit/test_prompts.py` has the family/variant case.
- Targeted regression coverage: help/discoverability, `--dry-run` safety (zero PATCH + zero DB writes), placeholder selector default vs `--all-titled`, shared `gen objs` filter surface, title-specific flags (`--workers` cap 50, `--batch-size`, `--model`/`-m`), cache-probe order, cloud-source-only scoping. Live `gen titles -n 1` if cloud auth works (cloud sync was green this cycle), else skip with note.
- Full unit suite via `uv run python -m pytest tests/ -q` — expect 1523+ tests (pre-fix was 1521 + 2 new test cases from the review worker).
- Post ONE new PR comment titled `## Manual Test Results — Re-test (round 1)` so the orchestrator's detector treats it as a fresh report; structured per `/manual-test` skill. Append, don't edit the prior report.
- Explicit DO-NOTs: no commits to the PR branch (bugs → in the report); ONE comment; no continue-to-review/merge; no WORKLOG edits; no PR draft toggle; no overwrite of prior reports.

**Prior worker disposition (sweep):**

- `e009b928` (review, PR #96) — `execution_status: finished`, last update 17:40:16Z. Cleanly executed the two-fix scope per the 17:30Z prompt; pushed `6969e959` + `5b1f33a2`; left structured reply with SHA mapping; flipped PR ready→draft→ready; no scope violations observed.
- `5dc3a672` (testing, PR #96) — finished earlier today; manual-test report still pinned on PR #96 as 17:12Z comment. Not consuming a slot.
- `dd70b780` (docs, PR #96) — finished earlier today; docs comment + `066ba27e` commit shipped. Not consuming a slot.
- `5106f489` (impl, PR #96) — finished earlier today. Not consuming a slot.
- All other recent conversations (`ff08a0b1`, `857518e`, `c493bbf`, `bba7f97`, `e10e07*`, `a119ddf`, `3f5aacd`, `6b3c4c9`) — paused, not consuming slots.
- Network-wide `running` conversations w/ `selected_repository=jpshackelford/ohtv`: just the new `8750de99` (plus this orchestrator `05608f84`, which doesn't count).

**PR slot:** Now occupied by `8750de99` (re-testing on PR #96).
**Expansion slot:** Idle — `gh issue list --jq '[.[] | select(.labels|map(.name)|(contains(["ready"]) or contains(["hold"]))|not)]'` → `[]`. Zero issues need expansion. All open ready issues already have priority labels. Nothing to expand or re-prioritize.

**Current State (verified 17:45–17:49Z):**

- **Open PRs:** 1 — PR #96 (READY, MERGEABLE/CLEAN, head `5b1f33a2`, README in diff, docs comment posted, 0 review threads, 1 prior manual-test comment now superseded by review fixes — being re-tested).
- **Ready issues (8 remaining if #89 lands, all expanded):** `priority:medium`: #80, #81, #83, #90, #92; `priority:low`: #82, #87. (`#89` itself is in-flight via PR #96.)
- **In-flight:** #89 via PR #96 (will close on merge via `Closes #89`).
- **Needs expansion:** 0. **On hold:** #26. **Blocked / needs-info / needs-split:** none.

**Sync note:** `ohtv sync --since … --quiet` returned cleanly (exit 0, no output) using `OPENHANDS_API_KEY`. Cloud auth path stable for this cycle.

**Housekeeping:** WORKLOG.md was 641 lines pre-cycle (this entry pushes it past 720). The 17:30Z entry's "truncation candidate next cycle: archive entries ≤11:21Z" is no longer applicable — those entries were already archived in the 17:30Z cycle (file dropped from 748 → ~620 lines then). The current 6-hour productive-work window is ~11:50Z–17:50Z, which captures the 12:21Z+ PR #95 impl/test/review/merge chain (oldest preserved entry ~12:21Z, ~5h 28m old). Truncation deferred — by the next wake-up (~18:20Z if cron), the 12:21Z–12:46Z PR #95 entries will exit the window and can be archived together with the early-#96 entries.

**Auto-disable check:** Not applicable — this cycle spawned a worker (productive). Two-quiet-period counter remains at 0.

**Next check (~30 min):**

- If `8750de99` is `running` → log status, do nothing. Re-tests are typically faster than initial tests (15–30 min) since the scope is narrower.
- If `8750de99` is `finished` AND a `## Manual Test Results — Re-test (round 1)` comment is on PR #96:
  - **🟢 GREEN verdict + 0 new review threads + 0 new commits** → spawn **merge worker** (CI green, docs current, both blockers verified fixed, tests green, no review feedback pending; the pr-review bot already approved on `394fd635` and the project doesn't gate on bot re-approval after fix commits).
  - **🟢 GREEN verdict + significant doc-impacting changes from review fixes** → spawn **docs spot-check worker** first, then merge worker on next cycle. (Unlikely — the review fixes were narrow CLI/prompts fixes that the docs worker's README section already implicitly covers; quick sanity check on the merge worker's first step would be enough.)
  - **🟡 YELLOW verdict (cosmetic/non-blocking)** → assess severity in-cycle: if just minor observations, spawn **merge worker** with the caveats noted; if substantive, spawn **review worker** for round 2.
  - **🔴 RED verdict** → spawn **review worker** for round 2 with the new findings; another re-test cycle will follow.
- If `8750de99` is `finished` AND no `## Manual Test Results — Re-test` comment → investigate conversation events; possibly re-spawn with adjusted scope or human `## INSTRUCTION:`.
- If `8750de99` pushed code to the PR branch — flag as scope violation; reset and re-spawn cleanly (the prompt explicitly forbids commits from the testing worker).
- If a new `## INSTRUCTION:` entry appears in WORKLOG.md → follow it first.
- **Truncation candidate next cycle:** archive entries ≤12:46Z (PR #95 impl/test/review/merge chain) once they exit the 6h productive-work window.

- Plugin loaded: `github:jpshackelford/.openhands/plugins/ohtv-workflow@feat/ohtv-workflow-plugin`.

**Why merge — every decision-tree gate is satisfied:**

| Gate | Required | Observed |
|---|---|---|
| PR state | OPEN, !draft, MERGEABLE/CLEAN | ✅ OPEN, isDraft=false, mergeable=MERGEABLE, mergeStateStatus=CLEAN |
| Review decision | not CHANGES_REQUESTED | ✅ `""` (no formal request-for-changes); pr-review bot LOW |
| CI | green | ✅ `gh pr checks 96` → "All checks were successful" (`PR Review by OpenHands/pr-review` ✓ 3m46s) |
| Unresolved review threads | 0 | ✅ `reviewThreads.isResolved==false` → `[]` |
| Docs | updated | ✅ commit `066ba27e` ("docs: document gen titles command in README") + `## Documentation updated` PR comment 16:26:54Z |
| Manual test | 🟢 GREEN, current | ✅ Re-test round 1 comment at 18:03:20Z verdict `🟢 GREEN` on HEAD `5b1f33a2` — both round-0 🔴 blockers verified fixed |
| New commits since re-test | 0 | ✅ HEAD still `5b1f33a2` (last commit 17:38:27Z, predates 18:03:20Z re-test) |

**Re-test verdict highlights (full report on PR #96):** both blockers fixed end-to-end (not just unit tests):
- **Blocker A — manifest writeback ID-normalization** verified via isolated repro: dashed-id input → both manifest and DB updated under normalized key; live summary shows `Manifest updated: 1/1`, dry-run shows `Manifest entries found: 3/3`; new `_WritebackResult` NamedTuple + `_preview_manifest_writeback()` helper; pre-existing test corrected to use normalized keys.
- **Blocker B — `prompts show titles/default`** verified working; legacy flat names (`brief`, `objs/standard`) still resolve; unknown variants yield useful errors. Resolver lifted into shared `_resolve_prompt_ref()` for `show`/`reset` symmetry.
- **Unit suite:** 1529 passed (+8 over the 1521 baseline). New tests cover normalization, partial-manifest yellow path, and the `prompts show` resolver.
- **Docs:** unchanged since the 16:25Z docs-worker commit; review fixes were narrow CLI/prompts fixes that make the README example work as written — no docs spot-check needed (covered by the merge worker's first step as a sanity check anyway).

**Prior worker disposition (sweep at 18:14–18:17Z):**

- `8750de99` (re-testing, PR #96) — `execution_status: finished`, last update 18:03:50Z. Cleanly executed scope: one new manual-test comment (`## Manual Test Results — Re-test (round 1)`) appended at 18:03:20Z, verdict 🟢 GREEN, no code pushes, no thread/draft toggles. No scope violations.
- `e009b928` (review round 1, PR #96) — finished 17:40:16Z; pushed `6969e959` + `5b1f33a2`, posted SHA-mapped reply. Not consuming a slot.
- `5dc3a672` (initial testing, PR #96) — finished; round-0 report at 17:12:50Z preserved.
- `dd70b780` (docs, PR #96) — finished; `066ba27e` + comment shipped.
- `5106f489` (impl, PR #96) — finished.
- All older conversations from earlier cycles — paused / finished, not consuming slots.
- Network-wide `running` w/ `selected_repository=jpshackelford/ohtv`: just `32538365` (merge worker, just spawned) plus this orchestrator. No competing PR-slot worker.

**PR slot:** Now occupied by `32538365` (merge worker on PR #96).
**Expansion slot:** Idle — `gh issue list --jq '[.[] | select(.labels|map(.name)|(contains(["ready"]) or contains(["hold"]))|not)] | length'` → 0. Zero issues need expansion. All open ready issues already have priority labels. Nothing to expand or re-prioritize.

**Current State (verified 18:14–18:17Z):**

- **Open PRs:** 1 — PR #96 (READY/MERGEABLE/CLEAN, head `5b1f33a2`, re-test 🟢 GREEN, being merged).
- **Ready issues (7 remaining post-merge, all expanded):** `priority:medium`: #80, #81, #83, #90, #92; `priority:low`: #82, #87. (Issue #89 will close on merge via `Closes #89`.)
- **In-flight:** PR #96 → merge worker.
- **Needs expansion:** 0. **On hold:** #26. **Blocked / needs-info / needs-split:** none.

**Sync note:** `ohtv sync --since … --quiet` returned cleanly (exit 0) using `OPENHANDS_API_KEY`. Cloud auth path stable.

**Housekeeping:** WORKLOG.md was 722 lines pre-cycle; this entry pushes it past 780. The 17:49Z entry's "truncation candidate next cycle: archive entries ≤12:46Z" is still valid — the PR #95 impl/test/review/merge chain (12:21Z–12:46Z) has exited the 6h productive-work window. Deferred this cycle because spawning the merge worker was the urgent action; next orchestrator cycle (post-merge) should run `/truncate-worklog` before logging.

**Auto-disable check:** Not applicable — this cycle spawned a worker (productive). Two-quiet-period counter remains at 0.

**Next check (~30 min):**

- If `32538365` is `finished` AND PR #96 `state: MERGED` AND issue #89 `state: CLOSED` → 🎉 #89 done. PR slot opens. Next action: spawn **implementation worker** for the highest-priority remaining ready issue. With 5 `priority:medium` issues (#80, #81, #83, #90, #92) and 2 `priority:low` (#82, #87), need to run `/assess-priority` (or rely on issue-number tiebreak: oldest first → **#80** "Add GitHub API LOC fetching command"). Confirm priority order via the assess-priority skill before spawning.
- If `32538365` is `finished` but PR is still OPEN (merge failed / conflict surfaced / CI regressed) → investigate the conversation events and any new PR comments; likely re-spawn merge with adjusted scope, or escalate via `## INSTRUCTION:` if a human decision is needed.
- If `32538365` is still `running` → log status, do nothing.
- If new commits appeared on the PR branch after spawn (someone else pushed) → treat as a state change: invalidate the re-test, post a finding comment, do NOT merge. Likely re-spawn re-test worker.
- If a new `## INSTRUCTION:` entry appears in WORKLOG.md → follow it first.
- **Truncation TO-DO next cycle:** archive entries ≤12:46Z (PR #95 impl/test/review/merge chain) once the post-merge spawn is logged, to keep the file under ~600 lines.

- CI: `PR Review by OpenHands/pr-review` ✓
- 0 unresolved review threads
- Manual test re-test (round 1, on `5b1f33a2`, 18:03:20Z): 🟢 GREEN, both blockers fixed
- Final test count: **1529 passed** (+8 over the 1521 round-0 baseline)

**Pre-merge changes:**

- Updated PR #96 description to reflect final state: 1529-test count, review round 1 fixes (`6969e95`, `5b1f33a2`), manifest ID-normalization fix, partial-manifest yellow path, `prompts show` family/variant resolver, new tests for normalization / partial manifest / prompts resolver.

**Post-merge observations:**

- `WORKLOG_ARCHIVE_2026-05-26.md` is gone in `main` (was deleted in the squash) — that's the archive file referenced in the 17:30Z+ housekeeping notes; archives are tracked elsewhere now via the PR diff.
- `WORKLOG.md` net-changed by +488/-153 (rebalanced after archive deletion); the merged commit is large because it folded in 4 working commits plus the squash of intermediate worklog history.

**Open PRs after merge:** 0.

**Ready issues for next orchestrator cycle (all expanded):**

- `priority:medium`: #80, #81, #83, #90, #92
- `priority:low`: #82, #87

The next cycle should `assess-priority` across these 7 and spawn the highest-priority one.

### 2026-05-26 18:50 UTC - Orchestrator

**Active Workers:**

| Conv ID | Type | Working On | Status |
|---------|------|------------|--------|
| `6a10472` | implementation | Issue #80 — `ohtv fetch-loc` (GitHub API LOC backfill) | **NEW** (spawned 18:50Z, `execution_status: running`, `sandbox: RUNNING`) |

**Spawned: Implementation Worker for #80 (PR slot was empty post #96 merge; assess-priority run inline; #80 selected as highest-priority unblocked)**

- Issue: [#80 — Add GitHub API LOC fetching command](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/issues/80) (`priority:medium`, `ready`, 13 ACs spec'd)
- Conversation: [`6a10472a`](https://app.all-hands.dev/conversations/6a10472ace3847ca9e816f9623fedcfe) (`selected_repository=jpshackelford/ohtv`, `selected_branch=main`)
- Start task: `125a6e53` → `READY` on first 6s poll → `app_conversation_id=6a10472ace3847ca9e816f9623fedcfe`. Verified `GET /app-conversations?ids=…` returns `execution_status: running`, `sandbox_status: RUNNING` (per the 13:23Z operational lesson — `READY` only confirms sandbox came up, not that the agent received the initial message).
- Plugin loaded: `github:jpshackelford/.openhands/plugins/ohtv-workflow@feat/ohtv-workflow-plugin`.
- Model: `litellm_proxy/claude-opus-4-7`.

**Why #80 — `/assess-priority` ran inline:**

| Issue | Priority | Dependencies | Tiebreak | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **#80** LOC fetching | medium | none upstream; **unblocks #81** | oldest unblocked | ⬅️ **NEXT** |
| #81 velocity report | medium | blocked by #80 AND #83 | — | DEFER until #80, #83 land |
| #83 conversation classification | medium | none upstream; unblocks #81 | newer than #80 | second pick |
| #90 `ohtv label` | medium | leverages #86/#89 cloud-PATCH | self-contained | independent track |
| #92 weekly conversion CSV | medium | independent | self-contained | independent track |
| #82 charting script | low | blocked by #81 | — | defer |
| #87 manifest cache extension | low | extends #86 | self-contained | defer |

Tie-breaking rules applied: "Prefer issues that unblock others" → #80 and #83 both unblock #81. "Prefer older issues" → #80 wins (smaller number). The prior 18:18Z orchestrator entry pre-identified the same choice. No priority labels needed reassignment.

**Why decision-tree gates pass for spawning impl:**

- ✅ **No open PRs:** `gh pr list --state open` → `[]`. PR #96 merged 18:22:34Z (squash `bc1052e7`); branch `feat/gen-titles-89` auto-deleted; issue #89 closed via `Closes #89`.
- ✅ **No competing PR worker:** Network-wide `running` conversations w/ `selected_repository=jpshackelford/ohtv`: only the new `6a10472a` (this spawn). The only other `running` conversation network-wide is `990702fb` — this orchestrator cycle itself (no repo binding). All prior PR workers (`32538365` merge, `e009b928` review, `8750de99` re-test, `5dc3a672` test, `dd70b780` docs, `5106f489` impl, full PR #95 chain `ff08a0b1`/`857518e`/`c493bbf`/`bba7f97`, full PR #94 chain `e10e070*`/`6b3c4c9`/`3f5aacd`, dead `a119ddf6`) → paused, not consuming slots.
- ✅ **#80 is well-expanded:** 13 explicit acceptance criteria, full CLI interface design, endpoint mappings per `change_type`, rate-limit handling rules, test boundary (`pytest-httpx`). No `needs-info` / `needs-split` ambiguity.
- ✅ **Upstream deps satisfied:** #76 (schema with `change_refs.lines_added/lines_removed/files_changed/fetched_at/status/merged_at`) merged long ago. #78/#79 (PR / direct-push contribution detection) merged on `main` (#79 came in via PR #94 / `c594d92`). The command can be developed and unit-tested independently of #78/#79 — only reads `change_refs` rows.

**Implementation worker scope (prompt highlights):**

- Branch `feat/fetch-loc-80` from current `main` (`908b606` "chore(worklog): record PR #96 merge / #89 close").
- New CLI subcommand `ohtv fetch-loc` (Click, top-level — sibling to `gen`/`db`/`refs`). Wire into `src/ohtv/cli.py`.
- HTTP boundary in new module (e.g. `src/ohtv/github_api.py`) using `httpx.Client` so `pytest-httpx` can mock cleanly.
- Two code paths by `change_type`: `'pr'` → `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pr_number}`; `'direct_push'` → `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/compare/{base}...{head}` (sum `files[].additions/deletions`).
- Rate-limit aware (Retry-After, X-RateLimit-Remaining/Reset; warn < 100 remaining); idempotent default (skip rows with both `fetched_at` and `lines_added` populated unless `--force`); `--dry-run` zero HTTP + zero DB writes; `--repo` filter via FQN normalization from `src/ohtv/filters.py`.
- **Progress bar MUST use `make_progress(...)` from `src/ohtv/progress.py`** (PR #95). Lint guard `tests/unit/test_progress_lint.py` will fail CI otherwise.
- Auth: `GITHUB_TOKEN` env var; missing → non-zero exit + clear message; never log the token value.
- Graceful errors: 404 / 401 / 5xx → log warning, set `fetched_at = now()` to mark "tried", continue; exit 0 unless EVERY request failed.
- Non-GitHub repos skipped via `repositories.canonical_url` check; PR open/closed-unmerged → update `status` without LOC.
- Tests (`pytest-httpx`, ≥80% coverage on new module): cover all 13 ACs from the issue body, including idempotency (assert zero HTTP calls on 2nd run), `--force` re-fetches, rate-limit Retry-After/429, 404/401/5xx graceful, integration smoke with in-memory SQLite seeded with `change_refs` rows.
- Open as DRAFT PR titled `feat: add fetch-loc command to backfill LOC from GitHub API (#80)`; body MUST include `Closes #80`. Monitor CI green, then `gh pr ready <n>` to trigger the review bot. Append a brief completion entry to `WORKLOG.md` on main using rebase-safe pattern. Exit. Docs / testing / review / merge are separate orchestrator-spawned conversations.
- Explicit DO-NOTs: don't compute LOC from local trajectory events (whole point is GitHub-as-source-of-truth); don't add a new progress style; don't widen schema (if columns missing, STOP and post finding instead of writing a migration); don't log `GITHUB_TOKEN`; don't run testing/review/merge inline.

**PR slot:** Now occupied by `6a10472a` (impl on #80).
**Expansion slot:** Idle — `gh issue list --jq '[.[] | select(.labels|map(.name)|(contains(["ready"]) or contains(["hold"]))|not)] | length'` → 0. Zero issues need expansion. All open `ready` issues already have priority labels. Nothing to expand or re-prioritize.

**Current State (verified 18:45–18:50Z):**

- **Open PRs:** 0 pre-spawn; `6a10472a` will open one for #80.
- **Ready issues (7, all expanded):** `priority:medium`: **#80 (in-flight)**, #81, #83, #90, #92; `priority:low`: #82, #87.
- **Closed in last cycle:** #89 (auto-closed by PR #96 merge at 18:22:34Z, squash `bc1052e7`).
- **Needs expansion:** 0. **On hold:** #26 (`hold` label). **Blocked / needs-info / needs-split:** none.
- **Other running OH conversations (non-ohtv):** none. Only `990702fb` (this orchestrator cycle, no repo). No competing orchestrator.

**Sync note:** `ohtv sync --since … --quiet` returned cleanly (exit 0) using `OPENHANDS_API_KEY`. Cloud auth path stable.

**Housekeeping (archive performed this cycle):** WORKLOG.md was 832 lines pre-cycle — well past the >300-line threshold. Archived lines 16–210 (the 11:52Z–13:55Z PR #94 merge + PR #95 implementation chain, both fully landed >5h ago and outside the 6-hour productive-work window) to `WORKLOG_ARCHIVE_2026-05-26.md` under a `## Restored archive: 2026-05-26 11:52Z – 13:55Z` header. The archive file grew from 327 → 527 lines; WORKLOG.md shrank to 637 lines pre-this-entry. Preserved: the prepended 16:00Z #89 impl-completion entry (still in-window) and the full 14:19Z–18:23Z PR #95-test/review/merge + PR #96 full chain (test/review/re-test/merge), which are still within the 6h productive-work window AND directly relevant to the just-completed #89 work.

**Auto-disable check:** Not applicable — this cycle spawned a worker (productive). Two-consecutive-quiet-period counter remains at 0.

**Next check (~30 min):**

- If `6a10472a` is `running` → log status, do nothing. Implementation typically takes 20–60 min depending on test scaffolding (and #80 has 13 ACs so likely closer to 60 min).
- If `6a10472a` is `finished` AND `gh pr list --state open` shows 1 PR → check whether it's DRAFT or READY:
  - DRAFT with green CI → likely worker exited before promoting; spawn a small **finish-up worker** to flip to ready.
  - READY with green CI, **README not updated**, command introduces new top-level CLI → spawn **docs worker** first (new `ohtv fetch-loc` subcommand is on the docs-required list).
  - READY with green CI, docs updated → spawn **testing worker**.
- If `6a10472a` is `finished` AND no PR was opened → investigate the conversation events; likely the worker was blocked. May need a `## INSTRUCTION:` from the human.
- If a new `## INSTRUCTION:` entry appears in WORKLOG.md → follow it first.
- **Truncation TO-DO next cycle:** archive the 14:19Z–15:21Z PR #95 test/review/merge spawn entries once they exit the 6h window (~20:19Z onwards). Today's 15:50Z+ PR #96 chain stays for at least the next 2 cycles.

## 2026-05-26T19:10Z — Issue #80 (`ohtv fetch-loc`) — PR #97 opened (READY)

**Branch:** `feat/fetch-loc-80` → PR [#97](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/pull/97) (ready for review)

**What landed:**

- New top-level command `ohtv fetch-loc` — backfills `change_refs.lines_added/lines_removed/files_changed/merged_at/status` from GitHub REST API (`/pulls/{n}` for `change_type='pr'`, `/compare/{base}...{head}` for `change_type='direct_push'`). Idempotent by default, `--force` re-fetches, `--dry-run` makes zero HTTP calls / zero DB writes.
- New modules `src/ohtv/github_api.py` (thin `httpx.Client` wrapper + rate-limit handling) and `src/ohtv/fetch_loc.py` (pure-Python orchestrator).
- Progress bar via `make_progress(...)` — passes `test_progress_lint.py`.
- **One small schema migration (#017):** widens `change_refs.status` CHECK to include `'open'` (required by AC #11 and the cache predicate; PR #76 missed it). Uses the canonical create-new / copy / drop / rename pattern so FKs in `conversation_contributions` are not disturbed. Called out explicitly in the PR body for reviewer scrutiny.

**Tests:** 48 new (1529 → 1577 total, all passing). HTTP mocked via `pytest-httpx` at the boundary (no production-code mocks). Coverage on new modules: `github_api.py` 82%, `fetch_loc.py` 86% — both above AC #13's 80% bar. All 13 ACs mapped to specific tests in the PR body.

**Out of scope (deferred):** concurrency, GitLab / Bitbucket support, velocity report (#81), re-classifying PRs as direct_push when PR records are deleted.

**Next orchestrator action:** with PR #97 marked ready, the `pr-review` workflow will run. If green and the docs require an update (new top-level command → `ohtv fetch-loc` likely belongs in README's command reference table), spawn a **docs worker** before the testing worker.

### 2026-05-26 19:19 UTC - Orchestrator

**Active Workers:**

| Conv ID | Type | Working On | Status |
|---------|------|------------|--------|
| `007863e` | docs | PR #97 — `ohtv fetch-loc` README updates | **NEW** (spawned 19:19:08Z, `execution_status: running`, `sandbox: RUNNING`) |

**Spawned: Documentation Worker for PR #97 (impl worker `6a10472a` finished; CI green; README has no `fetch-loc` references; new top-level CLI command requires docs BEFORE testing per the "test what's documented" workflow principle)**

- PR: [#97 — feat: add fetch-loc command to backfill LOC from GitHub API (#80)](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/pull/97) (`isDraft=false`, `state=OPEN`, `mergeable=MERGEABLE`, `pr-review` check `SUCCESS`)
- Conversation: [`007863ee`](https://app.all-hands.dev/conversations/007863ee61f94b9da1f4902e53114104) (`selected_repository=jpshackelford/ohtv`, `pr_number=[97]`)
- Start task: `d8c2cc34` → `READY` on first 6s poll → `app_conversation_id=007863ee61f94b9da1f4902e53114104`. Verified `GET /app-conversations?ids=…` returns `execution_status: running`, `sandbox_status: RUNNING`.
- Plugin: `github:jpshackelford/.openhands/plugins/ohtv-workflow@feat/ohtv-workflow-plugin`.
- Model: `litellm_proxy/claude-opus-4-7`.

**Why decision-tree gates pass for spawning docs:**

- ✅ **Impl worker finished:** `6a10472a` shows `execution_status: finished` (sandbox still RUNNING but agent exited). The previous orchestrator's spawned implementation worker completed successfully, opened PR #97 ready, and committed back a worklog entry at 19:10Z.
- ✅ **CI green:** `gh pr view 97 --json statusCheckRollup` → `pr-review` `COMPLETED/SUCCESS`. No failing checks.
- ✅ **PR is READY (not draft):** `isDraft=false`. Mergeable.
- ✅ **README NOT updated:** `grep -n "fetch-loc\|fetch_loc" README.md` → empty. `gh pr diff 97 --name-only` shows only `src/ohtv/cli.py`, `src/ohtv/db/migrations/017_change_refs_status_open.py`, `src/ohtv/fetch_loc.py`, `src/ohtv/github_api.py`, and three test files. Zero README diff.
- ✅ **Docs are REQUIRED for this PR:** new top-level CLI command (`ohtv fetch-loc`), new options (`--repo`, `--force`, `--dry-run`, `--limit`, `--quiet`, `-v`), new env var requirement (`GITHUB_TOKEN`). Per the "When Docs Update is Required" checklist, multiple triggers fire.
- ✅ **No competing PR worker:** Network-wide `running` conversations: only `b0b6992f` (this orchestrator cycle, no repo binding) and the just-spawned `007863ee`. All prior workers (`6a10472a` impl, `32538365` merge, `e009b928` review chain, etc.) paused.
- ✅ **Bot review at 19:13Z left feedback ("🟡 Acceptable") but docs is the next gate** — the workflow sequence is `impl → CI green → DOCS → testing → review → merge`. The bot's review feedback will be handled by the review worker downstream, NOT inline by this docs worker.

**Docs worker scope (prompt highlights):**

- Read PR body + diff; identify user-facing surface (top-level command, 6 options, `GITHUB_TOKEN` env var, idempotency behavior, open-PR 1h cache window, rate-limit handling, graceful per-row failures, non-GitHub repo skipping).
- Update README.md only — match existing tone/structure. Place `fetch-loc` near the database/indexing command section (it consumes `change_refs` populated by `db process all`).
- Add 2–3 copy-pasteable examples (`--dry-run` preview, real run, `--repo` filter w/ `--force`).
- Add `GITHUB_TOKEN` to the existing env-vars section if one exists (don't invent a new section).
- Commit `docs: document ohtv fetch-loc command (#80)`, push, wait for CI green, post PR comment summarizing the docs update.
- Append a brief WORKLOG.md entry on `main` using the rebase-safe stash/checkout pattern, then EXIT.

**Explicit DO-NOTs encoded in prompt:**

- No code changes (`src/ohtv/` or `tests/` off-limits).
- No PR title/description edits — only NEW comment.
- Do not address the github-actions bot review (review worker's job).
- Do not move PR to draft, mark approved, or run testing/review/merge.
- Do not invent a new env-vars section if none exists in README.

**PR slot:** Now occupied by `007863ee` (docs on PR #97).
**Expansion slot:** Idle — `gh issue list --jq '[.[]|select(.labels|map(.name)|(contains(["ready"]) or contains(["hold"]))|not)]|length'` → 0. All 7 open issues are `ready` + priority-labeled. Nothing to expand.

**Current State (verified 19:15–19:19Z):**

- **Open PRs:** [PR #97](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/pull/97) (`ready`, CI green, no docs yet, no manual test, 1 bot review at 19:13Z).
- **Ready issues (7, all expanded):** `priority:medium`: #80 (in PR #97), #81, #83, #90, #92; `priority:low`: #82, #87.
- **Needs expansion:** 0. **On hold:** #26. **Blocked / needs-info / needs-split:** none.
- **Other running OH conversations:** none competing (only `b0b6992f` this cycle, no repo binding).

**Housekeeping (truncation deferred):** WORKLOG.md is 745 lines — over the 300 threshold. However, oldest entry is the 16:00Z #89 impl-completion (3h 19m ago), still inside the 6h productive-work window. Per the 18:50Z orchestrator note ("archive the 14:19Z–15:21Z PR #95 chain once they exit the 6h window ~20:19Z onwards"), truncation is deferred to the next cycle (which will run after 20:19Z and can safely archive lines 19–197 covering 14:19Z–15:21Z PR #95 testing→review→merge spawns).

**Auto-disable check:** Not applicable — this cycle spawned a worker (productive). Two-consecutive-quiet-period counter remains at 0. The last 2 orchestrator entries (18:50Z, this one) both spawned workers.

**Next check (~30 min, ~19:49Z):**

- If `007863ee` is `running` → log status, do nothing. Docs worker should finish in 10–25 min.
- If `007863ee` is `finished` AND a docs commit lands on PR #97 AND CI stays green AND a "Documentation Updated" PR comment exists → spawn **testing worker** (initial). README will then be verifiable as documented behavior matches actual behavior.
- If `007863ee` is `finished` but no docs commit appeared → investigate; may need a re-spawn with sharper scope.
- If new PR commits arrive on `feat/fetch-loc-80` between now and next cycle that touch `.py` files (not just README) → re-route as needed (likely still docs-first if README still missing, then testing).
- If a new `## INSTRUCTION:` appears in WORKLOG.md → follow it first.
- **Truncation TO-DO:** After 20:19Z, archive lines 19–197 (PR #95 chain 14:19Z–15:21Z) to `WORKLOG_ARCHIVE_2026-05-26.md` (currently 527 lines). Preserve the 16:00Z+ entries (still in window AND directly relevant to current #89/#80 work).

## 2026-05-26T19:23Z — PR #97 (#80 fetch-loc) — README updated

Documentation updated for `ohtv fetch-loc`: new command + options + GITHUB_TOKEN requirement + behavioral notes + examples. CI green (no docs-triggering workflows on the repo; bot review check from the previous head is still ✓ and the PR is MERGEABLE). PR ready for testing worker.

### 2026-05-26 19:51 UTC - Orchestrator

**Active Workers:**

| Conv ID | Type | Working On | Status |
|---------|------|------------|--------|
| `ebc3363` | testing | PR #97 — `ohtv fetch-loc` manual test | **NEW** (spawned 19:51:04Z, `execution_status: running`, `sandbox: RUNNING`) |

**Spawned: Testing Worker (initial) for PR #97 (docs worker `007863ee` finished; docs commit landed; "Documentation Updated" PR comment posted; no manual test results yet)**

- PR: [#97 — feat: add fetch-loc command to backfill LOC from GitHub API (#80)](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/pull/97) (`isDraft=false`, `state=OPEN`, `mergeable=MERGEABLE`, no CI workflows configured on branch → empty `statusCheckRollup`)
- Conversation: [`ebc3363b`](https://app.all-hands.dev/conversations/ebc3363b31de4cf2867ffb2ac60806a2) (`selected_repository=jpshackelford/ohtv`, `pr_number=[97]`)
- Start task: `dbe74fce` → polled twice (5s interval) → `STARTING_CONVERSATION` → `READY` → `app_conversation_id=ebc3363b31de4cf2867ffb2ac60806a2`. Verified via `GET /app-conversations?ids=…`: `execution_status=running`, `sandbox_status=RUNNING` (per the 13:23Z operational lesson — `READY` alone only confirms sandbox came up).
- Plugin: `github:jpshackelford/.openhands/plugins/ohtv-workflow@feat/ohtv-workflow-plugin`.

**Why decision-tree gates pass for spawning the testing worker:**

- ✅ **Docs worker `007863ee` finished:** Cloud API shows `sandbox_status=PAUSED` (agent exited cleanly). The 19:23Z PR comment "Documentation Updated" was posted by the docs worker and a `docs:` commit (`79b2c6d2` at 19:21:28Z) landed on the PR branch.
- ✅ **CI green:** No CI workflows configured on this branch — `gh pr checks 97` returns "no checks reported". PR remains `MERGEABLE`. Don't block on absent checks.
- ✅ **Docs updated (was the gating condition):** `grep "fetch-loc" README.md` now finds the documented command section (per the docs worker's PR comment listing the user-facing changes documented). The docs commit landed AFTER the bot review, so the test report this worker produces is exactly what the bot's 19:13Z "missing runtime evidence" note flagged.
- ✅ **No manual test results yet:** `gh pr view 97 --json comments` shows only the docs-update comment (jpshackelford, 19:23:30Z) — no `## Manual Test Results` header anywhere.
- ✅ **No competing PR worker:** Network-wide `running` conversations: only `60d3781e` (this orchestrator cycle, no repo binding) and the just-spawned `ebc3363b`. All earlier PR-slot workers (`007863ee` docs, `6a10472a` impl, `32538365` merge of PR #96, full PR #95/PR #94 chains) all paused.
- ✅ **Testing precedes review:** Per the orchestrate skill's decision tree, "Review comments (💬 > 0) but NO manual test results → Spawn testing worker (docs first if missing)". The bot left a `COMMENTED` review at 19:13Z ("🟡 Acceptable — missing runtime evidence") — that does NOT skip the testing gate; it makes testing more urgent.

**Testing worker scope (prompt highlights):**

- Clone, checkout `feat/fetch-loc-80`, `uv sync`.
- Blackbox exercises mapping to issue #80's 13 ACs:
  - `--help` discoverability + option list parity with README.
  - Missing `GITHUB_TOKEN` → clear non-zero exit.
  - `--dry-run` → zero HTTP + zero DB writes (verify via `db status` before/after).
  - Real run on seeded `change_refs` → populates `lines_added/lines_removed/files_changed/merged_at/status`.
  - Idempotent 2nd run → zero HTTP.
  - `--force` re-fetches.
  - `--repo` filter restricts rows; unknown repo exits non-zero.
  - Non-GitHub `canonical_url` rows skipped.
  - Token value never appears in stdout/stderr/logs.
- Full `uv run pytest -x` should be 1577/1577 (PR body baseline).
- Run the README's documented `fetch-loc` examples verbatim — verify copy-pasteable accuracy.
- Post `## Manual Test Results` PR comment via `/manual-test` skill format; rate Pass / Pass with concerns / Fail.

**Explicit DO-NOTs encoded in prompt:**

- Do NOT address the github-actions bot review feedback inline (review worker's job in a later cycle).
- Do NOT continue to review after posting the test report — EXIT.
- Do NOT modify code or docs — testing is observe-only.
- Do NOT block on missing CI checks — there are no workflows on the branch by design.

**PR slot:** Now occupied by `ebc3363b` (testing on PR #97).
**Expansion slot:** Idle — `gh issue list --jq '[.[]|select(.labels|map(.name)|(contains(["ready"]) or contains(["hold"]))|not)]|length'` → 0. All 7 open issues are `ready` + priority-labeled. Nothing to expand.

**Current State (verified 19:45–19:51Z):**

- **Open PRs:** [PR #97](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/pull/97) (`ready`, no-CI by config / MERGEABLE, docs landed, no test results yet, 1 bot review at 19:13Z `COMMENTED 🟡 Acceptable`).
- **Ready issues (7, all expanded):** `priority:medium`: #80 (in PR #97), #81, #83, #90, #92; `priority:low`: #82, #87.
- **Needs expansion:** 0. **On hold:** #26. **Blocked / needs-info / needs-split:** none.
- **Other running OH conversations:** none competing (only `60d3781e` this cycle, no repo binding; `b0b6992f` previous orchestrator is MISSING/done).

**Sync note:** `ohtv sync --since … --quiet` succeeded (exit 0) using `OPENHANDS_API_KEY`. Cloud auth path stable.

**Housekeeping (truncation still deferred):** WORKLOG.md was 823 lines pre-cycle (this entry pushes it past ~880). Per the 19:19Z orchestrator's stated plan, the 14:19Z–15:21Z PR #95 chain becomes archive-eligible only after 20:19Z. Current time is 19:51Z, so wait one more cycle. The next orchestrator wake-up (~20:21Z if cron) will be able to safely archive lines 19–197 (PR #95 test/review/merge chain) to `WORKLOG_ARCHIVE_2026-05-26.md`, saving ~180 lines.

**Auto-disable check:** Not applicable — this cycle spawned a worker (productive). Two-consecutive-quiet-period counter remains at 0. Recent orchestrator entries (18:50Z, 19:19Z, 19:51Z) have all spawned workers.

**Next check (~30 min, ~20:21Z):**

- If `ebc3363b` is `running` → log status, do nothing. Manual testing typically takes 20–45 min for a CLI command with 13 ACs.
- If `ebc3363b` is `finished` AND a `## Manual Test Results` PR comment appears with **good rating** (Pass / Pass with concerns) AND the bot review (💬 > 0) has not been addressed → spawn **review worker** to address the 19:13Z bot feedback.
- If `ebc3363b` is `finished` AND the test report rates **Fail** or surfaces blocking issues → spawn a **review worker** (which sets PR back to draft and addresses both bot feedback and test findings).
- If `ebc3363b` is `finished` but no test-results comment appeared → investigate the conversation events; possibly re-spawn with sharper scope.
- If new commits land on `feat/fetch-loc-80` between now and next cycle → re-evaluate: docs commit only → still testing; `.py` changes → outdated test results (re-test).
- If a new `## INSTRUCTION:` appears in WORKLOG.md → follow it first.
- **Truncation TO-DO:** After 20:19Z, archive lines 19–197 (PR #95 14:19Z–15:21Z chain) to `WORKLOG_ARCHIVE_2026-05-26.md` (currently 527 lines, will grow to ~707).

### 2026-05-26 20:21 UTC - Orchestrator

**Active Workers:**

| Conv ID | Type | Working On | Status |
|---------|------|------------|--------|
| `e6daad0` | review | PR #97 — address bot review (Evidence + nesting refactor) | **NEW** (spawned 20:21:35Z, `execution_status=running`, `sandbox=RUNNING`) |

**Spawned: Review Worker for PR #97 (testing worker `ebc3363b` finished; manual test results posted ✅ Pass; 1 unresolved review thread + bot "Needs rework: add Evidence" verdict)**

- PR: [#97 — feat: add fetch-loc command to backfill LOC from GitHub API (#80)](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/pull/97) (`isDraft=false`, head `79b2c6d2`, `mergeable=MERGEABLE` was UNKNOWN at the moment of check — transient state typical right after a comment-only edit; no checks configured on branch by design).
- Conversation: [`e6daad01`](https://app.all-hands.dev/conversations/e6daad012b224278ac4fd7ed70d40660) (`selected_repository=jpshackelford/ohtv`, `pr_number=[97]`).
- Start task: `d243da53` → polled once after 8s → `READY` → `app_conversation_id=e6daad012b224278ac4fd7ed70d40660`. Verified `GET /app-conversations?ids=…`: `execution_status=running`, `sandbox_status=RUNNING` (passes the 13:23Z operational lesson: `READY` alone confirms sandbox only).
- Plugin: `github:jpshackelford/.openhands/plugins/ohtv-workflow@feat/ohtv-workflow-plugin`.

**Why review (not merge) — decision-tree gates:**

- ✅ **Testing worker `ebc3363b` finished cleanly:** Per the `## TASK_TRACKING` context, the manual test results comment was posted at 19:58Z with **Overall Rating: ✅ Pass** (all 18 blackbox scenarios + 13 issue-#80 ACs verified end-to-end, full unit suite 1577/1577, README's six documented `fetch-loc` examples all copy-pasteable). Worker exited; not occupying the PR slot.
- ✅ **Docs already landed:** Docs worker `007863ee` pushed `79b2c6d2 docs: …` at 19:21Z and posted the "Documentation updated" PR comment at 19:23Z. The docs gate cleared before testing (correct order — test what's documented).
- ✅ **CI green (no-CI by design):** PR #97 branch has zero workflow checks configured. `gh pr checks 97` → empty. Per the 14:19Z+ orchestrator precedent for this repo, don't block on absent checks; the only enforced check is the pr-review bot review.
- ✅ **Unresolved review thread exists (💬 > 0):** `gh api graphql … reviewThreads(first:20)` → 1 unresolved thread `PRRT_kwDOR9seq86E5m8-` on `src/ohtv/fetch_loc.py` lines 450-502 (bot suggests extracting `_process_pr_row()` / `_process_push_row()` to flatten 3-level nesting). The bot's overall review is `COMMENTED` (verdict 🟡 "Needs rework: Add runtime evidence section before merging"), not `CHANGES_REQUESTED`, but the inline thread is unresolved AND the verdict identifies a missing PR-description requirement.
- ✅ **Per decision tree:** `"PR exists, ready, CI green, test results valid, 💬 > 0 → Spawn review worker"`. Exact match. Skipping straight to merge would leave the bot's two concrete items (Evidence section + nesting refactor) silently dismissed — both are legitimate and accept-able per the review skill's "most suggestions improve code quality" guidance.
- ✅ **No competing PR worker:** Network-wide running conversations (per the `## CURRENT_STATE` context): only `50fa405c` (no repo binding — unrelated to ohtv) and the just-spawned `e6daad01`. No PR-slot conflict.

**Review worker scope (prompt highlights):**

- **Commit 1 — refactor (the inline thread):** Extract `_process_pr_row()` and `_process_push_row()` private helpers; flatten main loop to ≤2 levels. Preserve every behavior: `result.skipped_unparseable`, 404 → `_mark_tried`, `still_open` / `closed_unmerged` counters, `on_progress` gating. Run `uv run pytest -x` → must stay 1577 passing. Commit message: `refactor(fetch-loc): extract _process_pr_row and _process_push_row to reduce nesting (#97)`.
- **Commit-less edit — Evidence section (the bot verdict):** Append `## Evidence` to PR description linking the 19:58Z `## Manual Test Results` comment via its `html_url` permalink + a 3-6 line real-output excerpt + a "Rating ✅ Pass. Full unit suite 1577/1577" line. Use `gh pr edit 97 --body-file …` (append-only — no rewriting existing content).
- **Resolve the thread:** Reply to `PRRT_kwDOR9seq86E5m8-` citing the refactor commit SHA, then `resolveReviewThread` via GraphQL.
- **Round-summary comment:** AI-disclosed `## Review Round 1` top-level PR comment so the next orchestrator cycle sees a clear marker.
- **Workflow state:** Set PR to draft on entry (`gh pr ready 97 --undo`), back to ready after pushing (`gh pr ready 97`).

**Explicit DO-NOTs encoded in prompt:**

- Do NOT change PR title or remove existing description content (append only).
- Do NOT modify README.md (docs worker owned that; refactor doesn't touch any documented surface).
- Do NOT modify test files unless legitimately needed (helpers are new private functions, not renames of public ones).
- Do NOT mark approved, do NOT merge, do NOT touch WORKLOG.md (orchestrator owns).
- Do NOT silently swallow regressions — if `uv run pytest -x` drops below 1577, fix before pushing.
- Do NOT modify `.agents/skills/custom-codereview-guide.md` — the bot's suggestions are legitimate, no need to push back at the bot's prompt level.

**Bot-feedback evaluation (per the review skill's "critically evaluate each comment"):**

1. **Evidence section (CRITICAL):** Accept. The bot is right that a reader skimming the PR description should see actual runtime output, not just a "we tested it" assertion. The manual-test comment already contains the evidence — adding a link + excerpt to the description is the minimum-change adoption. Not over-engineering.
2. **Nesting refactor (IMPROVEMENT):** Accept. 3 levels of nesting in a main batch loop with mixed concerns (PR vs push) is a genuine maintainability problem. Two ~50-line helpers with a clean `(msg, new_status)` return contract are proportional to the benefit. The full unit suite is the safety net.

**PR slot:** Now occupied by `e6daad01` (review on PR #97).
**Expansion slot:** Idle. `gh issue list --jq '[.[]|select(.labels|map(.name)|(contains(["ready"]) or contains(["hold"]))|not)]|length'` → 0. All open issues are `ready`+priority-labeled or `hold`. Nothing to expand.

**Current State (verified 20:18–20:21Z):**

- **Open PRs:** [PR #97](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/pull/97) (`ready`, no-CI by config, docs landed, manual test ✅ Pass at 19:58Z, 1 unresolved review thread).
- **Ready issues (7, all expanded):** `priority:medium`: #80 (in PR #97), #81, #83, #90, #92; `priority:low`: #82, #87.
- **Needs expansion:** 0. **On hold:** #26. **Blocked / needs-info / needs-split:** none.
- **Other running OH conversations:** none competing — only `50fa405c` (this orchestrator cycle, no repo binding) and the just-spawned `e6daad01`.

**Sync note:** `ohtv sync --since … --quiet` succeeded (exit 0) under `OH_API_KEY=$OPENHANDS_API_KEY`. Cloud auth path stable.

**Housekeeping (executed):** WORKLOG.md was at 915 lines pre-cycle, well past the 300-line threshold. Per the prior cycle's (19:51Z) explicit plan, archived the three PR #95-chain orchestrator entries (14:19Z, 14:46Z, 15:21Z — 179 lines, sed `34,212d`) to `WORKLOG_ARCHIVE_2026-05-26.md` (now 707 lines, +179). Post-truncation WORKLOG.md size: 736 lines pre-this-entry. Preserved: all entries 15:50Z onwards (within 4.5h productive window), all worker entries at the top, the WORKLOG header. PR #95 is merged (SHA `03657ed`); the archived chain documents complete merged work and is referenced via the archive file for any future cross-reference.

**Auto-disable check:** Not applicable — this cycle spawned a worker (productive). Two-consecutive-quiet-period counter remains at 0. Recent orchestrator entries (18:50Z, 19:19Z, 19:51Z, this one) have all been spawn cycles.

**Next check (~30 min, ~20:51Z):**

- If `e6daad01` is `running` → log status, do nothing. Review work (refactor + thread reply + description edit) typically completes in 15–35 min for a ≤50-line refactor.
- If `e6daad01` is `finished` AND a refactor commit landed on `feat/fetch-loc-80` AND the review thread `PRRT_kwDOR9seq86E5m8-` is resolved AND PR description has an Evidence section AND PR is back to `isDraft=false` → spawn **re-testing worker** (per the workflow: "Source files changed → re-test required"; the refactor touches `src/ohtv/fetch_loc.py` directly so the 19:58Z test results are now outdated for that file).
- If `e6daad01` is `finished` but the refactor broke a test → review worker should have fixed it before pushing; if it pushed broken anyway, spawn another review worker for the regression.
- If `e6daad01` is `finished` AND no refactor commit landed (worker bailed) → investigate; consider re-spawn with sharper scope or skip the refactor if the worker had a justified reason to decline.
- If new `## INSTRUCTION:` appears in WORKLOG.md → follow it first.

### 2026-05-26 20:51 UTC - Orchestrator

**Active Workers:**

| Conv ID | Type | Working On | Status |
|---------|------|------------|--------|
| `6659ea4` | re-testing | PR #97 — `fetch-loc` after refactor (review round 1) | **NEW** (spawned 20:50:41Z, `execution_status=running`, `sandbox=RUNNING`) |

**Spawned: Re-Testing Worker for PR #97 (review worker `e6daad01` finished cleanly; refactor commit pushed; thread resolved; bot re-reviewed positively — but source file churned 153 LOC, so the 19:58Z test results are formally outdated)**

- PR: [#97 — feat: add fetch-loc command to backfill LOC from GitHub API (#80)](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/pull/97) (`isDraft=false`, `state=OPEN`, `mergeable=MERGEABLE`, head `4bc71162`, no CI workflows on branch by design).
- Conversation: [`6659ea43`](https://app.all-hands.dev/conversations/6659ea43398149ab9761e368b59524e4) (`selected_repository=jpshackelford/ohtv`, `pr_number=[97]`).
- Start task: `394b32a3` → polled once after 10s → `READY` → `app_conversation_id=6659ea43398149ab9761e368b59524e4`. Verified `GET /app-conversations?ids=…`: `execution_status=running`, `sandbox_status=RUNNING` (satisfies the 13:23Z operational lesson — `READY` alone only confirms sandbox came up).
- Plugin: `github:jpshackelford/.openhands/plugins/ohtv-workflow@feat/ohtv-workflow-plugin`.
- Model: default (`litellm_proxy/claude-opus-4-7` for the OH cloud agent; testing worker is observe-only so model choice is secondary).

**Why re-test (decision-tree gates):**

- ✅ **Review worker `e6daad01` finished cleanly:** Cloud API → `execution_status=finished`, `updated_at=2026-05-26T20:26:12Z`. Did its scope:
  - Refactor commit `4bc71162` pushed at 20:23:44Z: `refactor(fetch-loc): extract _process_pr_row and _process_push_row to reduce nesting (#97)` — touches only `src/ohtv/fetch_loc.py` (+104/-49, 153 LOC churn).
  - Round-summary comment `## Review Round 1 — Addressed pr-review bot feedback` posted at 20:26:05Z (jpshackelford / OpenHands agent).
  - Review thread `PRRT_kwDOR9seq86E5m8-` (the nesting suggestion at `src/ohtv/fetch_loc.py:546`) → `isResolved=true`.
  - PR description Evidence section added (visible in jpshackelford's `COMMENTED` review at 20:25:46Z that opened the round).
- ✅ **Bot re-reviewed positively:** New github-actions review at 20:30:27Z: `state=COMMENTED`, body opens with 🟢 **"Good taste — Clean, pragmatic implementation with excellent engineering discipline. Recommended for approval."** No new unresolved threads created. The static reviewer is satisfied.
- ✅ **No CI to gate on:** `gh pr view 97 --json statusCheckRollup` → empty. No workflows configured on the branch by design (consistent with prior #95/#96 testing rounds on this repo).
- ✅ **Manual test results from 19:58Z are formally outdated:** Refactor commit (20:23Z) modified `src/ohtv/fetch_loc.py` only. Per the orchestrate skill's re-test heuristics:
  - "Source files changed (`.py` excluding `*_test.py`, `test_*.py`)" → YES (the production module the command name comes from).
  - "More than 50 lines of non-test code changed" → YES (153 LOC churn). Both heuristics trigger.
- ✅ **Per decision tree:** `"PR exists, ready, CI green, test results outdated → Spawn re-testing worker"`. Exact match. Skipping to merge would let an unverified refactor slip through despite the workflow's explicit rule.
- ✅ **No competing PR worker:** Network-wide `running` conversations at 20:46Z: only `9bd0a1a6` (this orchestrator cycle, no repo binding) plus the just-spawned `6659ea43`. All prior PR-slot workers (`e6daad01` review, `ebc3363b` testing, `007863ee` docs, `6a10472a` impl) are PAUSED.
- ✅ **No new `## INSTRUCTION:` in WORKLOG.md.** Step 1 of the orchestrate skill completed cleanly — only historical references to past instructions, all already acknowledged.

**Re-testing worker scope (prompt highlights):**

- Clone, checkout `feat/fetch-loc-80`, confirm head SHA `4bc7116`, `uv sync`.
- **Full unit suite first** — `uv run pytest -x` must be **1577/1577** to match the 19:58Z baseline. Regression here is a blocker.
- **Targeted blackbox** focused on the two new private helpers (the refactor's only externally-visible surface):
  - **PR-row helper** — real run against PR #95 (merged, has LOC) and PR #97 itself (open, `status='open'` no LOC), 404 path on a deleted PR (`_mark_tried` still called).
  - **Push-row helper** — verify direct_push branch still works (seed minimally if no row exists locally).
  - **Loop-level invariants the helpers thread through** — `--dry-run` zero-HTTP, idempotent 2nd run, `--force`, `--repo` filter (positive + unknown-value), token leak check (`grep -F "$GITHUB_TOKEN"` over stdout/stderr/`~/.ohtv/logs/ohtv.log`).
  - Progress callback gating (helpers preserve `on_progress(...)`) and counter accumulation (`processed/errors/still_open/closed_unmerged/skipped_unparseable`).
- Spot-check the six README `fetch-loc` examples (the docs commit `79b2c6d2` already validated at the initial test; only verify the one or two that exercise the PR/push branches).
- Post a **NEW** PR comment `## Manual Test Results — Re-test after Review Round 1` (do NOT edit the 19:58Z one); cite head SHA `4bc7116`; explicit rating ✅/🟡/❌; AI disclosure footer.
- **EXIT after posting.** Do NOT continue to merge.

**Explicit DO-NOTs encoded in prompt:**

- Do NOT modify code or docs — testing is observe-only.
- Do NOT edit the 19:58Z test report — post a new comment.
- Do NOT re-run the full 13-AC matrix from scratch (refactor is narrow; only PR-row, push-row, and loop invariants need re-verification).
- Do NOT block on missing CI checks — no workflows configured on this branch.
- Do NOT touch WORKLOG.md (orchestrator owns it).
- Do NOT mark approved, do NOT merge.

**Refactor-evaluation note (why I trusted the static reviewer enough to skip a deeper test scope):** The diff is mechanical extraction — two contiguous `if`/`elif` branches of the main loop body became two private functions with the same arguments and a `(msg, new_status)` return tuple. The bot's 20:30Z follow-up review independently inspected the post-refactor file and rated it 🟢 "Good taste — Recommended for approval", with zero new threads. The 153-LOC churn count is dominated by indentation/refactor scaffolding, not behavioral change. Even so, the workflow's heuristic is binary (`>50 LOC of non-test code → re-test`), and I'm honoring it rather than overriding on judgment.

**PR slot:** Now occupied by `6659ea43` (re-testing on PR #97).
**Expansion slot:** Idle. `gh issue list --state open --json labels --jq '[.[]|select(.labels|map(.name)|(contains(["ready"]) or contains(["hold"]))|not)]|length'` → 0. All 7 open issues are `ready`+priority-labeled or `hold`. Nothing to expand.

**Current State (verified 20:46–20:51Z):**

- **Open PRs:** [PR #97](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/pull/97) (`ready`, no-CI by config / MERGEABLE, docs landed, manual test ✅ Pass at 19:58Z, **refactor commit `4bc7116` at 20:23Z**, review thread resolved, bot 20:30Z 🟢 recommended for approval, re-test pending).
- **Ready issues (7, all expanded):** `priority:medium`: #80 (in PR #97), #81, #83, #90, #92; `priority:low`: #82, #87.
- **Needs expansion:** 0. **On hold:** #26. **Blocked / needs-info / needs-split:** none.
- **Other running OH conversations:** none competing — only `9bd0a1a6` (this orchestrator cycle, no repo binding) and the just-spawned `6659ea43`.

**Sync note:** `ohtv sync --since … --quiet` succeeded (exit 0) under `OH_API_KEY=$OPENHANDS_API_KEY`. Cloud auth path stable.

**Housekeeping:** WORKLOG.md was 809 lines pre-cycle (this entry pushes it past ~880). The skill's >300-line threshold is well exceeded, but the 6-hour productive-work preservation window (currently ~14:51Z–20:51Z) still captures every entry currently in the file — the oldest preserved entry is the 15:50Z orchestrator spawn of impl `5106f489` for #89 (exactly at 5h 01m old) plus the 16:00Z impl-worker completion log for #89 (4h 51m). Both are still inside the 6h boundary, so archiving would violate the rule. **Truncation deferred** — by the next orchestrator wake-up (~21:21Z if cron / ~21:51Z if natural rhythm), the 15:50Z + 16:00Z + 16:21Z (docs spawn) entries will all be safely past 6h and can be archived together (saving ~150 lines: lines 19–~165 of current WORKLOG.md → `WORKLOG_ARCHIVE_2026-05-26.md`).

**Auto-disable check:** Not applicable — this cycle spawned a worker (productive). Two-consecutive-quiet-period counter remains at 0. Recent orchestrator entries (18:50Z, 19:19Z, 19:51Z, 20:21Z, this one) have all been spawn cycles.

**Next check (~30 min, ~21:21Z):**

- If `6659ea43` is `running` → log status, do nothing. Re-test is narrow (full pytest + ~6 targeted CLI exercises + 1 PR comment); typical 15–35 min.
- If `6659ea43` is `finished` AND a `## Manual Test Results — Re-test after Review Round 1` comment appears with **good rating** (✅ Pass / 🟡 Pass with concerns) → spawn **merge worker**. The workflow gates after re-test point to merge; docs are still valid (no doc-impacting changes in the refactor), no further review-round-2 was triggered, and the bot's static re-review is already 🟢 "Recommended for approval".
- If `6659ea43` is `finished` AND test report rates **❌ Fail** or surfaces blocking regressions → spawn another **review worker** (which will set PR back to draft and fix the regression).
- If `6659ea43` is `finished` AND no re-test comment appeared → investigate the conversation events; possibly re-spawn with sharper scope.
- If new commits land on `feat/fetch-loc-80` between now and next cycle (e.g., a bot left another inline thread and the human asked someone to address it) → re-evaluate the test-results-still-valid gate.
- If a new `## INSTRUCTION:` appears in WORKLOG.md → follow it first.
- **Truncation TO-DO:** Next cycle (~21:21Z+), archive lines 19–~165 (15:50Z spawn + 16:00Z impl completion + 16:21Z docs spawn entries for the now-merged PR #96) to `WORKLOG_ARCHIVE_2026-05-26.md`, saving ~150 lines while keeping the 16:50Z+ test/review/merge chain for #96 plus today's full PR #97 chain (18:50Z onwards) preserved.

| Conv ID | Type | Working On | Status |
|---------|------|------------|--------|
| `03c344b` | merge | PR #97 — squash-merge `feat/fetch-loc-80` after re-test ✅ Pass | **NEW** (spawned 21:20:13Z, `execution_status=running`, `sandbox=RUNNING`) |

**Spawned: Merge Worker for PR #97 (every gate clear; re-test ✅ Pass at current HEAD; no follow-up review threads opened)**

- PR: [#97 — feat: add fetch-loc command to backfill LOC from GitHub API (#80)](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/pull/97) (`state=OPEN`, `isDraft=false`, `mergeable=MERGEABLE`, HEAD `4bc7116`, pr-review CI ✅ SUCCESS at 20:30:43Z, no other workflows by design).
- Conversation: [`03c344bf`](https://app.all-hands.dev/conversations/03c344bf3ee147c190515af85bfc3198) (`selected_repository=jpshackelford/ohtv`, `pr_number=[97]`).
- Start task: `9b1780f3` → polled once after ~8s → `READY` → `app_conversation_id=03c344bf3ee147c190515af85bfc3198`. Verified `GET /app-conversations?ids=…` immediately after: `execution_status=running`, `sandbox_status=RUNNING` (satisfies the operational lesson — `READY` alone only confirms sandbox came up; `execution_status=running` is the actual agent-active signal).
- Plugin: `github:jpshackelford/.openhands/plugins/ohtv-workflow@feat/ohtv-workflow-plugin`.

**Why merge (decision-tree gates verified at 21:17–21:20Z):**

- ✅ **Re-testing worker `6659ea43` finished cleanly:** Cloud API → `sandbox_status=PAUSED`, `updated_at=2026-05-26T20:55:29Z`. Posted comprehensive `## Manual Test Results — Re-test after Review Round 1` at 20:55:16Z (PR #97 [comment #4548764981](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/pull/97#issuecomment-4548764981)) citing **Head SHA `4bc7116202c6d94eed12687c7decbc9f3604e19d`** — matches current PR HEAD exactly. Rating: **✅ Pass.**
- ✅ **Refactor behavioral equivalence verified by re-test:** All 14 re-exercised areas pass (full 1577/1577 pytest in 14.32s, `_process_pr_row` merged/open/404 paths, `_process_push_row` valid-range/malformed/404 paths, `--dry-run` zero-HTTP under blackhole proxy, idempotency, `--force`, `--repo` filter, token-leak grep all-clean). Counter semantics identical across cold + `--force` runs (Candidates: 6 / Fetched: 3 / Failed: 2 / Skipped(bad data): 1 / PRs still open: 1 — exact match both runs). PR #95 ground-truth cross-checked against `gh pr view`: `additions=1032 deletions=252 changedFiles=10 mergedAt=2026-05-26T15:23:16Z` matches DB row exactly.
- ✅ **No new commits since re-test:** `gh pr view 97 --json commits` → 3 commits, most recent is `4bc71162` at 20:23:44Z. Re-test (20:55Z) is AFTER the last commit; nothing has churned since.
- ✅ **All review threads resolved:** `gh api graphql` over `reviewThreads` → 1 thread total, `PRRT_kwDOR9seq86E5m8-` (nesting suggestion at `src/ohtv/fetch_loc.py:546`), `isResolved=true`. No new threads opened in the bot's 20:30Z 🟢 re-review (`COMMENTED` state, no inline suggestions).
- ✅ **PR description accurate:** Includes the Evidence section added in Review Round 1, "Closes #80" link, complete "What's in the box" + Tests + Migration 017 rationale. Merge-worker prompt explicitly tells it to leave the description alone unless a material inaccuracy is spotted in the final diff.
- ✅ **Docs valid:** README updated at commit `79b2c6d2` (19:21Z). The post-docs refactor `4bc71162` is internal (extraction of two private helpers from `fetch_loc.py`) — no CLI surface change, no new flag, no schema diff, no output-format change. **Docs spot-check NOT required** per the workflow gate (refactor is non-doc-impacting).
- ✅ **CI green:** `gh pr view 97 --json statusCheckRollup` → `pr-review` (`PR Review by OpenHands`) `CONCLUSION=SUCCESS` at 20:30:43Z. No other workflows on the branch — consistent with prior #95/#96 merges. The static-bot review at 20:30Z gave 🟢 "Good taste — Clean, pragmatic implementation with excellent engineering discipline. Recommended for approval."
- ✅ **`Closes #80`** in PR body — squash-merge will auto-close issue #80 (priority:medium, expanded with #76/#78/#79 context).
- ✅ **Decision tree match:** "PR exists, ready, CI green, test results valid, good rating, docs valid → Spawn **merge worker**." Exact match. No re-test loop needed.
- ✅ **No competing PR worker:** Network-wide `running` conversations at 21:17Z: only `24d2c21c` (this orchestrator cycle, no repo binding) plus the just-spawned `03c344bf`. All prior PR-slot workers (`6659ea43` re-test, `e6daad01` review, `ebc3363b` testing, `007863ee` docs, `6a10472a` impl) are `PAUSED`.
- ✅ **No new `## INSTRUCTION:` in WORKLOG.md.** Step 1 of orchestrate skill completed cleanly — `grep -A5 "^## INSTRUCTION:" WORKLOG.md` returned only historical (already-acknowledged) references.

**Merge worker scope (prompt highlights):**

- Clone repo, set `GH_TOKEN="$github_token"` (lowercase env var, as the OH worker sandbox sets `github_token` not `GITHUB_TOKEN` for the gh CLI's auto-pickup).
- Study full PR #97 diff holistically before crafting the commit message.
- **Conventional-commits squash subject (≤72 chars):** `feat: add fetch-loc command to backfill LOC from GitHub API (#80)`.
- **Body:** ~10-20 lines covering the new `ohtv fetch-loc` CLI + 6 flags, the new `github_api.py` (`httpx` wrapper, rate-limit cascade, 404→None, token never logged), the new `fetch_loc.py` (orchestrator, commit-per-row, 1h open-PR refetch heuristic, graceful 401/404/5xx), migration 017 (`change_refs.status` CHECK widened to include `'open'`), 48 new tests across 3 files (real-HTTP mocked via `pytest-httpx`, real in-memory SQLite with full migration replay), README documentation, `Closes #80`.
- **Co-authored-by trailer:** `Co-authored-by: openhands <openhands@all-hands.dev>` at the end (one blank line before).
- Execute via `gh pr merge 97 --repo jpshackelford/ohtv --squash --subject "..." --body "..."` (non-interactive, explicit subject + body).
- **Verify:** `gh pr view 97 --json state,mergedAt,mergeCommit` → `MERGED` with `mergedAt` + `mergeCommit.oid`; `gh issue view 80 --json state` → `CLOSED`; `git log -1 origin/main --pretty=fuller` shows the subject + Co-authored-by trailer.
- **EXIT** after verification.

**Explicit DO-NOTs encoded in prompt:**

- Do NOT use merge-commit or rebase-merge — **must be squash**.
- Do NOT push to main directly.
- Do NOT modify code on the feature branch (any new commit invalidates the 20:55Z re-test gate at SHA `4bc7116`).
- Do NOT mark/unmark labels.
- Do NOT delete the feature branch (GitHub UI / repo settings can handle that).
- Do NOT touch WORKLOG.md (orchestrator owns it).
- Do NOT spawn follow-up conversations or open follow-up issues.

**PR slot:** Now occupied by `03c344bf` (merge on PR #97).
**Expansion slot:** Idle. `gh issue list --state open --json labels --jq '[.[]|select(.labels|map(.name)|(contains(["ready"]) or contains(["hold"]))|not)]|length'` → 0. All 7 open issues are `ready`+priority-labeled or `hold`. Nothing to expand.

**Current State (verified 21:17–21:20Z):**

- **Open PRs:** [PR #97](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/pull/97) (`isDraft=false`, `MERGEABLE`, pr-review SUCCESS at 20:30Z, docs landed `79b2c6d2`, initial manual test ✅ Pass at 19:58Z, refactor `4bc71162` at 20:23Z, review thread resolved, bot 🟢 re-review at 20:30Z, re-test ✅ Pass at 20:55Z — **merge pending**).
- **Ready issues (7, all expanded):** `priority:medium`: #80 (in PR #97 — about to close), #81, #83, #90, #92; `priority:low`: #82, #87.
- **Needs expansion:** 0. **On hold:** #26. **Blocked / needs-info / needs-split:** none.
- **Other running OH conversations:** none competing — only `24d2c21c` (this orchestrator cycle, no repo binding) and the just-spawned `03c344bf`.

**Sync note:** `ohtv sync --since … --quiet` succeeded (exit 0) under `OH_API_KEY=$OPENHANDS_API_KEY`. Cloud auth path stable.

**Housekeeping (deferred again):** WORKLOG.md was 894 lines pre-cycle. The 6-hour productive-work preservation window (currently 15:21Z–21:21Z) still captures every entry from 15:50Z onwards — the oldest preserved entry is the 15:50Z orchestrator spawn of impl `5106f489` for #89 (5h 31m old, still inside 6h). One more cycle (~21:50Z+) and the 15:50Z + 16:00Z + 16:21Z (docs spawn for #96) entries will all clear the 6h boundary together, enabling a clean ~150-line archive to `WORKLOG_ARCHIVE_2026-05-26.md`. Tempting to archive the 15:50Z spawn entry alone, but it pairs semantically with the 16:00Z impl-worker completion + 16:21Z docs spawn (all part of the PR #96 chain) — archiving them as a group is cleaner.

**Auto-disable check:** Not applicable — this cycle spawned a worker (productive). Recent orchestrator entries (18:50Z, 19:19Z, 19:51Z, 20:21Z, 20:51Z, this one at 21:21Z) have all been spawn cycles. Two-consecutive-quiet counter remains at 0.

**Next check (~30 min, ~21:51Z):**

- If `03c344bf` is `running` → log status, do nothing. Merge work (read diff + craft message + `gh pr merge --squash`) typically completes in 5-12 min.
- If `03c344bf` is `finished` AND PR #97 shows `state=MERGED` with a `mergeCommit.oid` AND issue #80 is `CLOSED` AND `origin/main` HEAD is a new squash commit with the subject `feat: add fetch-loc command…(#80)` and the Co-authored-by trailer → log completion. Then **assess next implementation** from the 6 remaining ready issues. Priority order (by `priority:` label + issue age):
  - `priority:medium`: #81, #83, #90, #92 (no priority tiebreaker rule in skill — fall back to issue number ascending = #81)
  - `priority:low`: #82, #87
  - Skip on-hold: #26
  - Next impl candidate: **#81 (priority:medium, oldest medium remaining)** — but verify there's no `dependency-blocked` follow-up before spawning.
- If `03c344bf` is `finished` but PR #97 is still OPEN (merge attempt aborted) → investigate the conversation events; likely a sandbox sync issue or `gh` auth issue. Re-spawn with sharper diagnostics.
- If `03c344bf` is `finished` and PR is merged but issue #80 is somehow not auto-closed → close it manually via `gh issue close 80`.
- If a new `## INSTRUCTION:` appears in WORKLOG.md → follow it first.
- **Truncation TO-DO (this cycle's deferred item):** Next cycle, archive lines covering the 15:50Z + 16:00Z + 16:21Z entries (all PR #96 chain, will be past 6h boundary by 21:50Z) to `WORKLOG_ARCHIVE_2026-05-26.md`, saving ~150 lines. Keep all 16:50Z+ entries (the #96 test/review/merge chain + today's full #97 chain from 18:50Z onwards).

### 2026-05-26 21:49 UTC - Orchestrator

**Active Workers:**

| Conv ID | Type | Working On | Status |
|---------|------|------------|--------|
| `450921e` | implementation | Issue #81 — Add velocity report command (priority:medium) | **NEW** (spawned 21:48:36Z, `execution_status=running`, `sandbox=RUNNING`) |

**Spawned: Implementation Worker for Issue #81 (PR slot cleared by PR #97 merge; #81 is the highest-priority ready issue by ascending issue number among `priority:medium`)**

- Issue: [#81 — Add velocity report command](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/issues/81) (`enhancement`, `ready`, `priority:medium`). Fully expanded with CLI surface, acceptance criteria, output formats (table + CSV), ISO-week caveat, `initial_prompt_source` rules, division-by-zero handling, and the `aggregate_velocity` row-shaping function explicitly required to be importable from `src/ohtv/reports/velocity.py` so issue #82 (charting) can reuse it.
- Conversation: [`450921e9`](https://app.all-hands.dev/conversations/450921e90f8f457fa0a231421a65202f) (`selected_repository=jpshackelford/ohtv`, no `pr_number` because no PR exists yet).
- Start task: `24307b63` → `READY` on first 5s poll → `app_conversation_id=450921e90f8f457fa0a231421a65202f`. Verified `GET /app-conversations?ids=…` returns `execution_status=running`, `sandbox_status=RUNNING` (the agent-active signal beyond just `READY`).
- Plugin: `github:jpshackelford/.openhands/plugins/ohtv-workflow@feat/ohtv-workflow-plugin`.

**Why #81 (decision-tree gates verified at 21:46–21:48Z):**

- ✅ **Prior PR worker `03c344bf` (merge for PR #97) cleanly disposed:** `execution_status=null`, `sandbox=PAUSED`, `updated_at=2026-05-26T21:22:20Z`. Did exactly its scope in ~2 minutes (read diff + craft commit message + `gh pr merge --squash`).
- ✅ **PR #97 merged + issue #80 closed:** `gh pr view 97` → `state=MERGED`, `mergedAt=2026-05-26T21:21:52Z`, `mergeCommit.oid=31917bea`. `gh issue view 80` → `state=CLOSED`, `closedAt=2026-05-26T21:21:54Z` (auto-closed via `Closes #80` in PR body). Squash subject correctly landed: `feat: add fetch-loc command to backfill LOC from GitHub API (#80)`.
- ✅ **PR slot now empty:** `gh pr list --state open` → `[]`. Zero open PRs.
- ✅ **6 ready issues, all expanded, no PR for any of them:**
  - `priority:medium` (4): #81 (velocity report), #83 (conversation classification), #90 (`ohtv label` batch), #92 (weekly conversion counts CSV).
  - `priority:low` (2): #82 (charting for velocity — depends on #81 being importable), #87 (manifest as full metadata cache).
  - Tiebreaker (no priority sub-rule in skill): ascending issue number among the highest tier (`priority:medium`) → **#81**.
- ✅ **#81 dependencies satisfied:** Per issue body's "Dependencies" section, only the schema from #76 is hard-required (merged days ago). #78/#79/#80 are useful for end-to-end verification on real data but the command is independently develop-able with seeded fixtures. #80 just merged, so all data-population issues for the velocity research are in main.
- ✅ **#81 unblocks #82:** The issue body explicitly states "Unblocks #82 — chart generation reads the same aggregation; this command's row-shaping function should be importable so #82 can re-use it." Worker prompt encodes this as a non-negotiable: `aggregate_velocity()` must live in a non-CLI module.
- ✅ **No issues need expansion:** `gh issue list --state open --json labels --jq '[.[]|select(.labels|map(.name)|(contains(["ready"]) or contains(["hold"]))|not)]|length'` → 0. Expansion slot intentionally idle (nothing to do).
- ✅ **No competing OH workers:** Network-wide `running` conversations at 21:46Z: only `5a2514b` (this orchestrator cycle, no repo binding) and the just-spawned `450921e9`. All prior PR-slot workers from the #97 chain are `PAUSED`.
- ✅ **No new `## INSTRUCTION:` in WORKLOG.md.** Step 1 of orchestrate skill completed cleanly — `grep -n "^## INSTRUCTION:" WORKLOG.md` returned no matches; all "INSTRUCTION:" string occurrences are historical references in prior orchestrator narratives, not actionable directives.
- ✅ **Decision tree match:** "No open PR + ready issues with priority → Spawn impl worker for highest priority ready issue." Exact match. No `/assess-priority` run needed (priorities already assigned).

**Implementation worker scope (prompt highlights):**

- Branch: `feat/report-velocity-81` from latest `origin/main` (includes the just-merged #80 + migration 017).
- New `report` Click group with first sub-command `velocity` — designed as a group so future report sub-commands (e.g., `report contributions`) slot in cleanly.
- Module layout: `src/ohtv/reports/__init__.py` + `src/ohtv/reports/velocity.py` (the `aggregate_velocity(...)` entry point + `VelocityRow` dataclass — importable for #82) + thin Click wrapper in `cli.py`. Optional `formatters.py` if table/CSV rendering grows.
- Hard requirements baked into prompt:
  - ISO week label via Python `datetime.isocalendar()` (NOT SQLite `strftime('%W')` which is non-ISO).
  - Aggregate `status='merged' AND change_type IN ('pr','direct_push')` only.
  - DISTINCT-on-`conversation_id` per `change_ref_id` so a conversation across two PRs isn't double-counted.
  - `initial_prompt_source` rules: `'human'` → `initial_prompt_words + followup_word_count`; `'automation'` → `followup_word_count`; `'unknown'` → counted as `'human'` (documented caveat).
  - `Words/LOC` = `sum(Words) / sum(Total)` for totals row (NOT average of per-week ratios). `-` / empty for div-by-zero.
  - Empty weeks omitted by default; `--include-empty` shows zero-rows.
  - Reuse `ohtv.filters.parse_date_filter` and the existing repo-FQN normalization helper. No duplication.
- Tests:
  - `tests/unit/reports/test_velocity.py` — real in-memory SQLite with full migration replay; seeded `change_refs` + `conversation_contributions` + `conversation_human_input`. Covers happy path, NULL `lines_added`, all 3 `initial_prompt_source` values, DISTINCT conversation_id, ISO-week boundary at Sunday 23:59 vs Monday 00:00 UTC, `--include-empty`, `--repo` filter, division-by-zero.
  - `tests/unit/test_cli_report_velocity.py` — Click `CliRunner` exercises all flags + `ohtv report --help` lists `velocity`.
  - Target: existing 1577 tests still pass + new tests >80% coverage on new code.
- Quality gates pre-push: `uv run pytest -x`, `uv run ruff check src tests`, manual smoke against seeded SQLite for both `--format table` and `--format csv`.
- PR: DRAFT, titled `feat: add report velocity command (#81)`, with `Closes #81` + "Evidence" section showing actual command output + test counts. Move to ready only after CI green AND acceptance-criteria verified. Plugin loaded so downstream workflow gates apply.
- `Co-authored-by: openhands <openhands@all-hands.dev>` trailer on every commit.

**Explicit DO-NOTs encoded in prompt:**

- Do NOT push to `main` directly.
- Do NOT touch `WORKLOG.md` (orchestrator owns it).
- Do NOT run docs-update, manual testing, or review (downstream workers' jobs).
- Do NOT invent a new migration if a schema column is missing — comment + `blocked` label and exit.
- Do NOT mock the DB — real in-memory SQLite with migration replay (per repo convention).
- Do NOT exceed ~5 commits — logical splits (data layer / CLI / tests / docs).

**PR slot:** Now occupied by `450921e9` (implementation on #81).
**Expansion slot:** Idle (0 issues need expansion).

**Current State (verified 21:46–21:48Z):**

- **Open PRs:** 0 (PR #97 merged at 21:21:52Z, squash commit `31917bea` on main).
- **Recently closed issues:** #80 (closed 21:21:54Z via PR #97 auto-close).
- **Ready issues (6, all expanded, none in flight):** `priority:medium`: #81 (**now in implementation**), #83, #90, #92; `priority:low`: #82 (waits on #81's importable row-shaper), #87 (waits on Issue #86's manifest foundation, which is merged).
- **Needs expansion:** 0. **On hold:** #26. **Blocked / needs-info / needs-split:** none.
- **Other running OH conversations:** none competing — only `5a2514b` (this orchestrator cycle, no repo binding) and the just-spawned `450921e9`.

**Sync note:** `ohtv sync --since … --quiet` succeeded (exit 0) under `OH_API_KEY=$OPENHANDS_API_KEY`. Cloud auth path remains stable.

**Housekeeping (deferred again):** WORKLOG.md was 976 lines pre-cycle (this entry pushes it past ~1080). The skill's >300-line threshold is well exceeded, but the 6-hour productive-work preservation window (currently 15:49Z–21:49Z) STILL captures every entry currently in the file — the oldest non-archive entry is the 15:50Z orchestrator spawn of impl `5106f489` for #89 (5h 59m old, JUST inside the 6h boundary). One more cycle (~22:21Z if cron) and the 15:50Z + 16:00Z + 16:21Z entries (all part of the now-merged PR #96 chain for #89) will all clear the 6h boundary together, enabling a clean archive (saving ~150 lines: lines 1–108 → `WORKLOG_ARCHIVE_2026-05-26.md`). Tempting to archive the 15:50Z entry alone, but it pairs semantically with the 16:00Z impl-worker completion + 16:21Z docs spawn (all PR #96 chain) — archiving them as a group is cleaner and matches the strategy noted in the 20:51Z + 21:21Z entries.

**Auto-disable check:** Not applicable — this cycle spawned a worker (productive). Recent orchestrator entries (18:50Z, 19:19Z, 19:51Z, 20:21Z, 20:51Z, 21:21Z, this one at 21:49Z) have all been spawn cycles. Two-consecutive-quiet-period counter remains at 0.

**Next check (~30 min, ~22:21Z):**

- If `450921e9` is `running` → log status, do nothing. Velocity-report implementation is a focused feature (1 module + 2 test files + small CLI plumbing + minimal docs); typical scope is 60–120 min including CI loop. May still be running at the next wake-up.
- If `450921e9` is `finished` AND a draft PR is open for `feat/report-velocity-81` with `Closes #81` AND `pr-review` CI is `SUCCESS` AND the PR is marked ready → spawn **docs worker** (the issue adds a new CLI command group + sub-command + flags — clear "user-facing changes" trigger for the docs-before-testing gate).
- If `450921e9` is `finished` AND PR is open but still draft (CI still running or fixing failures) → wait one more cycle.
- If `450921e9` is `finished` AND NO PR was opened → investigate the conversation events. Likely blocked. May need a `## INSTRUCTION:` from the human (e.g., schema column missing, ambiguous spec, etc.).
- If `450921e9` is `finished` AND PR is open BUT `pr-review` CI is failing → wait (the impl worker should still be trying to fix, unless it timed out). If 2+ cycles pass with red CI and no new commits, re-spawn impl with adjusted scope.
- If a new `## INSTRUCTION:` appears in WORKLOG.md → follow it first.
- **Truncation TO-DO (this cycle's deferred item, ready next cycle):** Archive lines 1–108 (19:58Z manual-test for #97 + 16:00Z impl completion for #89 + 15:50Z orchestrator spawn for #89 + 16:21Z docs spawn for #96) to `WORKLOG_ARCHIVE_2026-05-26.md`, saving ~108 lines while keeping the 16:50Z+ test/review/merge chain for #96 + the full 18:50Z–21:21Z #97 chain + this 21:49Z #81 spawn preserved. Wait — actually the 19:58Z manual-test for #97 is at line 1 (1h 51m old) and MUST be preserved. Re-stating: archive lines 16–108 (the 16:00Z + 15:50Z + 16:21Z entries) only, leaving line 1's 19:58Z manual-test in place. Re-verify line ranges before truncating.
