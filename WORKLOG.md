**Active Workers:**
| Conv ID   | Type           | Working On                                                 | Status  |
|-----------|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------|---------|
| `3a45a77` | orchestrator   | this cycle                                                 | running |
| `062c740` | merge          | PR #171 — squash-merged at 05:53Z (release ohtv-v0.23.0)   | finished, PAUSED |
| `4f5a012` | implementation | Issue #168 — `--with-engagement` flag on `gen objs` JSON   | **NEW** (running, sandbox RUNNING) |

**Spawned: Implementation Worker for Issue #168**
- Issue: [#168 — Add engagement fields to `ohtv gen objs` JSON output](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/issues/168) (`priority:high`)
- Conversation: [`4f5a012`](https://app.all-hands.dev/conversations/4f5a012415464e67ab82a4becb70d29d)
- Start task `572378d0` → READY in 1 poll (~25s); first verification call confirmed `execution_status=running, sandbox_status=RUNNING`.

**Step 0 — Setup:** `uv sync` from `/workspace/project/ohtv` succeeded — pre-existing `.venv` from the prior orchestrator cycle was reused (no full re-install). Followed up with `uv pip install git+...lxa` to get `lxa` on PATH inside the venv. **Validated next-cycle recommendation:** the "try `uv sync` from the repo root first" pattern worked first try, no `pip install --user` fallback needed. `ohtv sync` skipped — direct `gh`/`curl` queries proved sufficient for state-gather.

**Step 0.5 — Housekeeping:** WORKLOG.md is **1729 lines** at cycle entry (>>300; **18 consecutive cycles overdue** on truncation). Deferred again — productive cycle filling the PR slot. Same recommendation: human `## INSTRUCTION: archive WORKLOG.md entries older than 12h` or `/truncate-worklog` matcher fix.

**Step 1 — Human INSTRUCTION check:** 0 unacknowledged. `awk '/^\`\`\`/{f=!f;next} !f && /^## INSTRUCTION:/{print}' WORKLOG.md` returned no headings.

**Step 2/3 — Worker status check at cycle entry:**
- `062c740` (merge PR #171): `sandbox=PAUSED, exec=null` (reaped). Per its own worklog entry at 05:53Z: squash-merge succeeded (merge commit `fe476c77`), auto-release `ohtv-v0.23.0` published at 05:56:23Z (verified this cycle via `gh release view`), Issue #167 auto-closed.
- `414d420` (re-test PR #171): `sandbox=PAUSED, exec=null` (reaped from prior cycle).
- `8be2f9e` (review PR #171): `sandbox=PAUSED, exec=null` (reaped from prior cycle).
- API search for `selected_repository=jpshackelford/ohtv` shows only `3a45a77` (this orchestrator) as `execution_status=running` at cycle entry. All previously-spawned workers are `null`/PAUSED/MISSING.
- **Both slots CLEAR at cycle entry.**

**Step 4 — State gather:**
- **Open PRs (0):** PR #171 merged. PR slot freshly empty. 🎉
- **Recent merges:** #171 (05:53Z), #166 (02:51Z), #165 (00:25Z). Three engagement-metric/list-tooling PRs landed in the last ~6h.
- **Release:** [`ohtv-v0.23.0`](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/releases/tag/ohtv-v0.23.0) published at 05:56:23Z, `isDraft=false`.
- **Issue census:**
  - **Needs expansion (no `ready`, no `hold`): 0** — **4th consecutive cycle** with the expansion queue fully exhausted. 🎉
  - **Ready + prioritized: 5** — **#168**, **#169**, **#170** (all `priority:high`), **#161**, **#162** (both `priority:medium`). #167 closed by PR #171's squash commit (verified — no longer in the open-issues list).
  - **On hold:** #26, #90.

**Step 5 — Decisions:**
- **PR slot** → Spawn **implementation worker for Issue #168** (`4f5a012`). Decision-tree row matched: *"No open PR + ready issues with priority → Spawn impl worker for highest priority ready issue"*. **#168 is the next `priority:high` in the queue** (FIFO within priority tier: #168 < #169 < #170 by issue number). Worker prompt:
  - Pinned the `--with-engagement` flag name + 5 JSON field names (`engaged_seconds`, `attention_periods`, `engagement_threshold_seconds`, `total_duration_seconds`, `engagement_ratio`) to mirror PR #165 (`show`) and PR #171 (`list`) — explicit "no new schema" requirement.
  - Pointed the worker at `_format_eng_pct`, `_engagement_ratio`, `_validate_engagement_values` in `src/ohtv/cli.py` (the post-PR-#171 DRY helpers) for reuse.
  - Required draft PR + CI green before draft→ready transition.
  - Required worklog append to `main` per the skill's commit pattern.
  - Forbade docs/test work (separate workers in later cycles).
  - Resolved any conflict between issue body and PR #171 implementation in favour of PR #171 (already merged + tested).
- **Expansion slot** → **IDLE** (5th consecutive cycle). All 7 open issues are `ready` (5) or `hold` (2). Expansion queue stays empty until the engagement-metric family closes and new issues arrive.

**Step 6 — Quiet-cycle check:** Productive cycle (1 worker spawned, PR slot freshly filled). Auto-disable counter stays at **0**.

**Cycle expectations for next 1–3 cycles (~30–90 min):**
- **Next cycle (~06:51Z):** Likely outcomes —
  - ~50%: `4f5a012` still running (impl + tests + CI cycle typically 30-60m for a flag-addition + tests of this scope; PR #171's impl worker took ~90m end-to-end).
  - ~30%: Draft PR opened, CI running — spawn nothing (PR slot occupied).
  - ~15%: PR is ready + CI green + no docs comment → spawn **docs worker**.
  - ~5%: Worker reports a blocker (e.g., engagement data not populated for test fixtures) — would re-evaluate.
  - Expansion slot stays idle.
- **2 cycles out (~07:21Z):** PR #168 likely in docs → manual test → review cycle.
- **3 cycles out (~07:51Z):** PR #168 likely approved/merging. Queue then: **#169 (high) → #170 (high) → #161 (medium) → #162 (medium)**.

**Notes / follow-ups carried forward (cumulative, lightly pruned):**
- **WORKLOG.md size: 1729 → ~1815 lines post-entry. 18 consecutive cycles overdue on truncation.** Same recommendation.
- **Tool install pattern (refined):** `uv sync` from `/workspace/project/ohtv` worked first try this cycle — `.venv` from the prior orchestrator's setup was intact. The "try `uv sync` first, fall back to `pip install --user`" pattern from last cycle's notes is now empirically validated as the operative pre-flight check. Discarded the stray `uv.lock` modification before pulling main (no actual lock churn — `uv sync` regenerated it identically).
- **`GITHUB_TOKEN` empty, `github_token` populated:** Stable for 11 consecutive cycles. `export GH_TOKEN=$github_token` shim is durable; passed through to the implementation worker prompt.
- **Engagement-metric family — 1 closed, 3 in queue:** #167 closed by PR #171's squash-merge. Active queue: **#168 (in flight) → #169 → #170**. Then medium-priority pair: #161, #162.
- **`exec=finished, sandbox=RUNNING` vs `exec=null, sandbox=PAUSED` clean-exit variants:** Both observed across cycles. Treat identically.
- **Stale-HEAD safety check pattern:** Carried forward — future merge worker prompts should continue pinning expected `headRefOid` for safety.
- **Plugin spec format:** `plugins: [{"source": "github:owner/repo", "repo_path": "...", "ref": "..."}]`. Verified by this cycle's spawn (5th successful spawn in this orchestrator instance).

**Local checkout note:** `main` at `7348e90` (tag `ohtv-v0.23.0`). `git pull --ff-only` clean (already up to date — the v0.23.0 release commit is the current HEAD). Stray `uv.lock` change from `uv sync` discarded before append. Worklog entry committed directly to `main` per skill rule.

EXIT per orchestrate skill — next cycle (~30 min) checks `4f5a012` (impl PR #168) and decides next actions (likely no spawn if still running; possibly docs worker if PR is ready + CI green).

### 2026-06-04 07:50 UTC - Orchestrator

**Active Workers (at cycle exit):**

| Conv ID   | Type  | Working On                                                | Status                    |
|-----------|-------|-----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| `0607681` | merge | PR #172 — spawned to squash, **PR was human-merged @ 07:51Z** | **NEW** (running, see note) |
| `98fabf1` | testing | PR #172 — test report posted 07:42Z                     | finished, sandbox=RUNNING |

**Step 0 — Setup:** Reused existing `.venv` from prior orchestrator cycles in `/workspace/project/ohtv`. No tool re-install needed this cycle. Direct `gh`/`curl` queries used for state-gather; `ohtv sync` skipped.

**Step 0.5 — Housekeeping (deferred again):** WORKLOG.md at 1952 lines on entry (>>300, **20 consecutive cycles overdue**). Productive cycle (worker spawned + race-resolution entry) → deferred per skill rule.

**Step 1 — Human INSTRUCTION check:** 0 unacknowledged.

**Step 2 — Slot scan at cycle entry:** All non-self workers `null`/PAUSED except `98fabf1` (testing worker from 07:20Z cycle) which was `exec=finished, sandbox=RUNNING` — terminal/clean-exit. **Both slots clear.**

**Step 3 — State gather (at 07:47Z, before the human merge):**
- **Open PRs (1 at scan time):** [PR #172](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/pull/172) — `feat: add --with-engagement flag to gen objs JSON output`. `headRefOid=cabd1775babd41867c5fc0b5efd353d7292c3209`, CI green, `mergeable=MERGEABLE`, not draft, 0 review threads.
  - 06:54Z: Docs worker `5a0f995` posted "📝 Documentation updated".
  - 06:37:51Z: `github-actions[bot]` review **🟡 Acceptable, worth merging**. Sole advisory: nesting refactor in `_load_engagement_for_ids` (deferred).
  - 07:42:55Z: Testing worker `98fabf1` posted manual test results, verdict 🟢 **Ready to merge** (8 scenarios, real DB data, exact ratio math).
- **Issue census:** Needs expansion = 0 (6th consecutive cycle), ready+prioritized = 5 (#168→PR #172, #169, #170, #161, #162), on hold = 2 (#26, #90).

**Step 4 — Decisions:**
- **PR slot** → Spawned **merge worker `0607681`** for PR #172. Decision-tree match: "PR exists, ready, test results valid, good rating, docs valid → Spawn merge worker." First spawn attempt (`9896eb0a`) ERRORED with `404 Not Found` on the sandbox runtime URL — transient infra issue. **Retried after 5s and succeeded** (`4dca60f4` → READY in 1 poll, `app_conversation_id=06076811…`, `execution_status=running`).
- **Expansion slot** → IDLE (7th consecutive cycle).

**⚠ Race condition discovered at cycle close:**

When the orchestrator did its post-spawn `git pull --ff-only origin main` for the worklog commit (at ~07:53Z), it discovered:

```
01b4e7f (HEAD -> main, origin/main, origin/HEAD) feat: add --with-engagement flag to gen objs JSON output
```

- **PR #172 was squash-merged at 2026-06-04T07:51:33Z** by `John-Mason P. Shackelford <jpshack@gmail.com>` (the human owner), **NOT** by an OpenHands worker.
- Issue #168 auto-closed at 07:51:34Z (`Fixes #168`).
- The merge happened in the ~4 minute window between state-gather (07:47Z) and the spawned merge worker's first action.
- The squash commit message is comprehensive (lifts the full PR description body into the commit body) — no Co-authored-by trailers, no openhands disclosure footer.

**Implications for spawned merge worker `0607681`:**

The worker's prompt step 1 (stale-HEAD safety check) and step 6 (squash-merge) will both find the PR in `state: MERGED, mergedAt: 2026-06-04T07:51:33Z`. The worker should detect this on its first `gh pr view 172 --json state` call. **Expected behaviour:**

- ✅ Recognise PR is already merged → skip steps 1–6 entirely.
- ✅ Proceed to step 7 (post-merge verification): confirm `ohtv-v0.24.0` published, `pyproject.toml` / `__init__.py` on `0.24.0`.
- ✅ Proceed to step 8 (file the deferred-refactor follow-up issue `refactor: reduce nesting in _load_engagement_for_ids`). This is still useful work and the worker has the full context to file it correctly.
- ✅ Proceed to step 9 (worklog append). Worker should write a clear "PR was human-merged before I started; I verified release + filed follow-up issue" entry rather than claiming the merge.
- ⚠ **Risk**: Worker may try to `gh pr merge 172 --squash` regardless. `gh` will reject (`PR not in mergeable state` / `already merged`), so no actual damage — just a noisy error. Worker should handle gracefully.

**No corrective action taken this cycle.** The orchestrate skill mandates one action per wake-up; the merge worker will discover the state itself. Worst case it exits without filing the follow-up issue — next cycle can file it.

**Step 5 — Quiet-cycle check:** Productive cycle (1 worker spawned, even though redundant). Auto-disable counter stays at **0**.

**Cycle expectations for next 1–3 cycles (~30–90 min):**
- **Next cycle (~08:20Z):** Likely outcomes —
  - ~60%: `0607681` finished (detected merge, filed follow-up issue, verified release). PR slot opens → spawn **implementation worker for #169** (next `priority:high`).
  - ~25%: `0607681` finished but did NOT file follow-up issue (got confused by merged state) → next orchestrator files it inline, then spawns impl worker for #169.
  - ~10%: `0607681` still running (verifying release, etc.).
  - ~5%: Worker errored or stuck — would investigate.
- **2 cycles out (~08:50Z):** PR #169 likely in implementation. PR slot fills.

**Notes / follow-ups carried forward (cumulative, lightly pruned):**
- **Human-merge race (new this cycle):** Owner can merge a PR while an orchestrator cycle is mid-flight. Future merge worker prompts should explicitly handle the "PR already merged" case in step 1 (treat it as a clean exit, skip to steps 7–9). The post-test-comment window (07:42Z → 07:51Z, ~9 min) is when the human is most likely to merge directly — orchestrator cycles starting in that window should consider deferring the merge spawn for ~1–2 cycles or pre-checking `state=MERGED` immediately before the spawn call.
- **Pending follow-up refactor issue:** `refactor: reduce nesting in _load_engagement_for_ids` — `_load_engagement_for_ids` has 5 levels of nesting (`try → with conn → for chunk → for row → if hasattr`); pr-review-bot suggested extracting `_process_engagement_rows`. Labels: `enhancement` + `priority:low`. If `0607681` doesn't file it, next orchestrator should.
- **Spawn 404 retry pattern (new this cycle):** Transient `404 Not Found` on sandbox agent-server `/api/conversations` POST is recoverable with a single 5s-delay retry. Worth adding to the spawn-conversation skill if it recurs.
- **WORKLOG.md size: 1952 → ~2030 lines post-entry. 20 consecutive cycles overdue on truncation.**
- **Engagement-metric family — 2 closed, 2 in queue:** PR #171 closed #167; PR #172 closed #168 (human merge). Active queue: **#169 → #170**, then medium-priority pair: #161, #162.
- **Plugin spec format unchanged:** `plugins: [{"source": "github:jpshackelford/.openhands", "repo_path": "plugins/ohtv-workflow", "ref": "feat/ohtv-workflow-plugin"}]`. 7th successful spawn in this orchestrator instance using this exact shape.
- **Stale-HEAD safety check carried forward** for future merge worker prompts.
- **Testing-worker spawn gap from prior cycle resolved:** the 07:20Z orchestrator cycle (at the top of WORKLOG.md) is what spawned `98fabf1`. Newest-entries-at-top reading-order convention re-confirmed.

**Local checkout note:** `main` at `01b4e7f` (the squash merge). `git pull --ff-only` clean. Worklog entry committed directly to `main` per skill rule.

EXIT per orchestrate skill — next cycle (~30 min) checks `0607681` (merge worker, redundant) and most likely spawns the impl worker for **#169**. The `ohtv-v0.24.0` release should be live within 30s of the merge (verify with `gh release view ohtv-v0.24.0 --repo jpshackelford/ohtv` next cycle).

### 2026-06-04 08:20 UTC - Implementation Worker (Issue #169, PR #174)

**Task:** Issue #169 - Add engagement to gen objs markdown output (below Duration). Priority: high. Predecessors PR #171 (#167, list columns) and PR #172 (#168, JSON output) already merged on main at ae22b4d.

**Branch:** feat/169-engagement-markdown from origin/main@9c92e8b.

**Implementation (3 surgical edits to src/ohtv/cli.py, ~80 LOC):**
1. New helper `_format_engaged_markdown_subbullet(engagement, duration)` next to `_format_engaged_line` - same data + precision, drops the `of <duration> total` suffix because the parent bullet already shows duration inline.
2. Hoisted the engagement batch-load out of the JSON branch in `_run_batch_objectives_analysis` so it runs ONCE before the format dispatch and attaches each row to `r["engagement"]`. Both JSON (#168) and markdown (#169) formatters now read from the same dict. Single SQL query (chunked at 900 IDs by the pre-existing `_load_engagement_for_ids`).
3. `_format_summary_markdown` reads `r.get("engagement")` / `r.get("duration")` and inserts the `Engaged:` sub-bullet between the parent bullet and the existing refs / labels. Public signature `(results, *, include_outputs)` unchanged.
4. Updated `--with-engagement` help text to mention the markdown rendering effect.

**Tests:** New file `tests/unit/test_cli_gen_objs_engagement_markdown.py` - 29 tests covering helper (12) + formatter integration (8) + CLI via CliRunner (6) + help-text surface (1) + signature-stability regression (1) + ID-normalization (dashed caller, dashless DB row). All AC bullets from the issue have a corresponding test.

**Verification:**
- `uv run pytest tests/unit -q` -> 2353 passed, 2 skipped, 3 xfailed (38s). Zero regressions in the existing 86 engagement-stage tests (test_cli_engagement_display.py, test_cli_list_engagement.py, test_cli_gen_objs_engagement.py).
- `uv run ruff check src tests` -> 168 errors total, identical to main (verified with git stash round-trip). Zero new lint errors in my changes.
- CI on PR #174: lint pass 5s, pytest pass 1m5s, enable-orchestrator pass 2s, pr-review skipping (will run on ready). All green at 08:18Z.

**PR:** [#174](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/pull/174) - `feat: add engagement to gen objs markdown output`. Opened as draft, flipped to ready-for-review at 08:19Z (triggers pr-review bot). `Fixes #169` in description. Title is a valid Conventional-Commit subject so the python-semantic-release squash flow will minor-bump on merge.

**Out-of-scope (honored per orchestrator brief):**
- #173 (refactor `_load_engagement_for_ids` nesting) - separate issue, not in this PR.
- Docs update - docs worker will handle after CI green.
- Default-on `--with-engagement` - explicit follow-up once metric beds in (matches #167 / #168 rationale).

**Worker exits.** Docs / review / QA / merge are separate orchestrator-spawned conversations.

### 2026-06-04 10:20 UTC - Orchestrator

**Active Workers:**

| Conv ID | Type | Working On | Status |
|---------|------|------------|--------|
| `002934f` | merge | PR #174 — squash-merge | **NEW** (running, first poll) |

**Step 0 — Setup:** `uv venv .venv` + `uv pip install lxa ohtv` (system Python `site-packages` is read-only this cycle). `lxa repo add` was idempotent. `ohtv sync` skipped (this cycle is merge-gated, not data-gated).

**Step 0.5 — Housekeeping:** ✅ **Worklog truncated.** Was 2464 lines (24th consecutive overdue cycle); now **943 lines** before this entry. Kept 19 entries spanning the 6-hour productive window (cutoff `2026-06-04 03:55Z`). 26 entries archived to `WORKLOG_ARCHIVE_2026-05-30.md` (+1), `…_2026-06-02.md` (+8), `…_2026-06-03.md` (+6), `…_2026-06-04.md` (+11). Productive-anchor algorithm (`/truncate-worklog`) worked exactly as designed.

**Step 1 — Human Instructions:** None pending.

**Step 2 — Active Workers (pre-this-spawn):** Previous cycle's testing worker `84a32f4` reports `execution_status=finished`. PR slot is **free**. Expansion slot has been idle for multiple cycles.

**Step 3 — State gathered:**
- **Open PRs:** [#174](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/pull/174) — `feat: add engagement to gen objs markdown output` (closes #169), ready, branch `feat/169-engagement-markdown`.
- **PR #174 status (lxa-style):** `oAFc green ready` — `o`pened, **A**pproved (github-actions bot, 08:33Z), `F`ixes pushed (docs commit `4ba37ec` at 09:25Z), CI green (`lint` + `pytest` both SUCCESS), no unresolved review threads, `💬 0` from humans, manual test report posted at 09:58Z by `84a32f4` (verdict **ALL TESTS PASS** — 2353 passed). **Merge criteria met.**
- **Issues needing expansion:** 0 (all open issues already carry `ready`).
- **Ready issues (5):** #169 (priority:high, *merging now*), #170 (priority:high), #161 (priority:medium), #162 (priority:medium), #173 (priority:low).

**Step 4 — Decision (per orchestrate decision tree):**
- PR slot: `PR exists, ready, CI green, docs updated, test results valid, good rating, docs valid` → **Spawn merge worker.** ✅
- Expansion slot: no issues need expansion → **stay idle.** ✅

**Step 5 — Spawned: Merge Worker**
- PR: [#174 — feat: add engagement to gen objs markdown output](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/pull/174) (closes #169)
- Start task: `b6921de6` → `app_conversation_id = 002934fe65ca48d4b8e483814350dbd8`
- Conversation: [`002934f`](https://app.all-hands.dev/conversations/002934fe65ca48d4b8e483814350dbd8)
- Polling timeline: `SETTING_UP_SKILLS` (T+0s) → `STARTING_CONVERSATION` (T+5s) → `READY` (T+10s). First-attempt success, single-cycle spawn.
- Verify (T+~15s): `execution_status=running`, `sandbox_status=RUNNING`. **Confirmed actually executing.**
- Plugin spec (unchanged, 12th successful spawn): `{"source": "github:jpshackelford/.openhands", "repo_path": "plugins/ohtv-workflow", "ref": "feat/ohtv-workflow-plugin"}`.
- Spawn payload contract: `initial_message: {content: [{type:"text", text:"…"}], run: true}` (V1 — verified yet again).
- Prompt scope: holistic PR-diff review → update PR description → conventional-commit squash subject `feat: add engagement to gen objs markdown output (#169)` → `gh pr merge 174 --squash --subject … --body …` → verify merged → append WORKLOG.md merge entry on `main` → EXIT.

**Step 6 — Quiet-cycle check:** Productive cycle (1 worker spawned + worklog truncated). Auto-disable counter resets to **0**.

**Cycle expectations for next 1–3 cycles (~30–90 min):**
- **Next cycle (~10:50Z):** Most likely —
  - ~80%: `002934f` finished, PR #174 squash-merged with `feat:` subject → release workflow runs → new tag (`ohtv-vX.(Y+1).0`) → CHANGELOG entry. PR slot opens. → Spawn **implementation worker for #170** (`Filter conversations by engagement level`, priority:high, the next engagement-family issue).
  - ~15%: Merge worker still running (PR description rewrite + squash takes time).
  - ~5%: Merge worker hits an unexpected branch-protection or status mismatch and posts a comment instead of merging. (`statusCheckRollup` shows both SUCCESS, so unlikely, but `gh pr view --json mergeable,mergeStateStatus` did return `UNKNOWN/UNKNOWN` at check time — likely GitHub-side cache lag.)
- **2 cycles out (~11:20Z):** Implementation worker for #170 underway; expansion slot still idle.
- **3 cycles out (~11:50Z):** PR #175 (for #170) likely in draft or moving to ready.

**Notes / follow-ups carried forward (cumulative):**
- **`initial_message` spawn-payload contract** remains the high-priority pin (since 09:23Z diagnosis). 12 successful spawns in a row using `{"initial_message": {"content": [{"type":"text","text":"…"}], "run": true}}`. Never use the deprecated `initial_user_msg`.
- **Spawn auth header:** `X-Access-Token: $OPENHANDS_API_KEY` (the `/spawn-conversation` skill's documented header). Other endpoints accept `Authorization: Bearer …` — both work against the same key.
- **OpenHands Cloud API gotchas (still relevant):** `POST /api/v1/app-conversations` (no trailing slash); `start-tasks/search` returns `{"items": […]}`; poll start-task by `id` from the POST response, not by conv id.
- **Tool install pattern:** system Python `site-packages` was read-only this cycle — fell back to `uv venv .venv` + `uv pip install …`. Adds ~5s overhead but no behavior change. The `which lxa || install` guard still does the right thing.
- **Engagement-metric family progress:** #167 ✅ merged, #168 ✅ merged, **#169 → PR #174 merge in flight this cycle**, #170 next. After merge, **2/4 → 3/4 done.**
- **GitHub CLI:** `--json reviewThreads` is NOT a valid field on `gh pr view`. Use GraphQL (`pullRequest.reviewThreads`) for thread visibility. Cached.
- **`gh pr view --json mergeable,mergeStateStatus` returned `UNKNOWN/UNKNOWN`** even though `statusCheckRollup` showed both checks SUCCESS — likely a GitHub-side cache lag. **The `statusCheckRollup` is the source of truth for "is CI green?".** Cached.
- **`GITHUB_TOKEN` populated this cycle.** Shim `GH_TOKEN=${GITHUB_TOKEN:-$github_token}` still in carry-forward.
- **Plugin spec format unchanged:** 12th successful spawn.

**Local checkout note:** `main` HEAD at `aff3f9f` on entry; will advance with the worklog-truncation commit (archive files + truncated WORKLOG.md) plus this entry. No code branches created by orchestrator.

EXIT per orchestrate skill — next cycle (~30 min) checks `002934f` (merge worker) and, if PR #174 is merged, spawns the implementation worker for **#170** (`Filter conversations by engagement level`, priority:high).

### 2026-06-04 10:22 UTC - Merge Worker (PR #174)

✅ **Squash-merged PR #174 — `feat: add engagement to gen objs markdown output (#169)`.**

- Conv ID: `002934f` (this conversation)
- PR: [#174](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/pull/174) → state `MERGED`, merged at `2026-06-04T10:22:23Z`
- Merge commit: [`f140744`](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/commit/f140744e5199f30f94d326a0dfbc19c746941a2d)
- Closes: [#169 — Add engagement to `gen objs` markdown output (below Duration)](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/issues/169)
- Branch deleted by `gh pr merge --squash` (default).

**What shipped (holistic diff review):**
- `_format_engaged_markdown_subbullet` helper in `src/ohtv/cli.py` — mirrors `_format_engaged_line` precision (`XX.X%`) and grammar (singular `period` / plural `periods`) but drops the redundant `of <duration> total` suffix since the parent bullet already shows duration inline. Returns `None` on missing rows so the caller can silently omit the sub-bullet.
- `_run_batch_objectives_analysis` now batch-loads engagement rows **once** before format dispatch, then attaches `r["engagement"]` for both the JSON formatter (#168) and the markdown formatter (#169). Consolidates the prior #168-only load — single SQL query (chunked at 900 IDs by `_load_engagement_for_ids`), no N+1 in either format path.
- `_format_summary_markdown` reads `r.get("engagement")` / `r.get("duration")` and renders `  - Engaged: <duration> in N period[s] (X.X%)` between the parent bullet and the existing refs / labels sub-bullets. Public signature `(results, *, include_outputs)` unchanged — regression-tested.
- `--with-engagement` help text updated to mention both `-F markdown` and `-F json` effects.
- Docs touched: `docs/guides/analysis.md` (3 examples updated), `docs/reference/cli.md` (one help-text row).

**Key decisions (recorded for future readers):**
1. **Silent omission on missing rows.** Returns `None` from the helper and the caller skips the sub-bullet; no `Engaged: -` placeholder. Matches the AC and parallels the `_format_engaged_line` zero-duration handling.
2. **Singular/plural grammar.** `1 period` vs `N periods` — covered by an explicit helper test (`test_singular_period`). No `1 periods` ever.
3. **Percentage uses event-window duration, not `total_duration_seconds`.** The `(X.X%)` parenthetical divides by `r["duration"]` (carried on the result from the event window) rather than the engagement row's stored total. End-to-end flow keeps these identical; only synthetic seeding (as in the manual blackbox test) can drift them. Documented inline in the source comment and called out in the manual test report.

**Test coverage:**
- 29 new unit tests in `tests/unit/test_cli_gen_objs_engagement_markdown.py` (helper + formatter + CLI + help-text + signature-stability).
- Total: 2353 unit tests pass (2 skipped, 3 xfailed — the cloud-sync behavioral harness xfails per AGENTS.md "Testing" section).
- Manual blackbox: **15/15 scenarios pass** — comment [#4621055211](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/pull/174#issuecomment-4621055211). Highlights: byte-stable diff vs. flag-off (only the three new `Engaged:` lines differ), sub-bullet ordering before refs/labels, indentation parity, table-format no-op confirmed, JSON flag (#172) unaffected.

**PR description updated** prior to merge: appended a `## Verification (final state)` section linking the manual test comment, the CI status, and the review decision; added a `## Percentage derivation note` paragraph clarifying the `r["duration"]` vs `total_duration_seconds` distinction for future readers tripping over `>100%` values in synthetic test fixtures.

**Squash subject** (release-workflow-visible): `feat: add engagement to gen objs markdown output (#169)`. Per AGENTS.md "Releases & Commit Contract", this is a `feat:` subject → triggers a **minor version bump** and a new `Features` section in `CHANGELOG.md` on the next release-workflow run on `main` (expected within ~30s of this merge commit hitting `main`). Tag to watch: `ohtv-v0.25.0`.

**Engagement-metric family progress:**
- #167 ✅ merged (engagement processing stage + DB column)
- #168 ✅ merged (`--with-engagement` JSON output via PR #172)
- **#169 ✅ merged now (this PR — markdown sub-bullet)**
- #170 → next implementation target (`priority:high`, `ready`, expanded body — `Filter conversations by engagement level` via `--engaged` / `--min-engaged` / `--min-engagement-ratio`)

**Follow-ups noted in PR body (out of scope for #169):**
- #173 — refactor `_load_engagement_for_ids` for shared use (engagement family + future callers).
- Default-on `--with-engagement` — explicit follow-up once the metric beds in. Matches the rationale in #167 / #168.
- Schema-driven engagement column in `-F table` — explicit follow-up.

**Exit:** Merge worker done. Orchestrator's next cycle will pick up #170 implementation per the engagement-metric family progression.

### 2026-06-04 10:50 UTC - Orchestrator

**Active Workers:**

| Conv ID | Type | Working On | Status |
|---------|------|------------|--------|
| `1f83ee2` | implementation | Issue #170 — engagement filters | **NEW** (running, first poll) |

**Step 0 — Setup:** `uv tool install` for `lxa` + `ohtv` (system `site-packages` read-only again — same pattern as 10:20Z cycle, just used `uv tool install` instead of `uv venv` this time, equivalent outcome). `lxa repo add` idempotent. `ohtv sync` ran clean (no output).

**Step 0.5 — Housekeeping:** WORKLOG.md is **1055 lines** at cycle entry. Just truncated last cycle (10:20Z dropped from 2464 → 943). Productive cycle (1 worker spawned). **Defer truncation** — next cutoff will naturally drop the 10:20Z entry once it ages past the 6h window. Counter reset to "0 cycles overdue" after the 10:20Z truncation.

**Step 1 — Human Instructions:** None pending. `awk` over WORKLOG.md (excluding fenced code blocks) for `^## INSTRUCTION:` → empty.

**Step 2 — Active Workers (pre-this-spawn):** Prior cycle's merge worker `002934f` is `execution_status=null, sandbox_status=PAUSED` → **finished**. PR slot is **free**. Expansion slot has been idle for many cycles.

**Step 3 — State gathered:**
- **PR #174 — MERGED at 2026-06-04T10:22:23Z** (squash commit `f140744`). Closed Issue #169. **Engagement-metric family progress: 3/4 done** (#167 ✅, #168 ✅, #169 ✅, #170 next).
- **Release: `ohtv-v0.25.0` tagged** (auto-release ran on the squash-merge subject `feat: add engagement to gen objs markdown output (#169)`). `main` at `5124eec` (chore(release): ohtv 0.25.0 [skip ci]).
- **Open PRs:** 0. PR slot fully open.
- **Issues needing expansion:** 0 (`{ready, hold}` ∪ closed covers all 6 open issues).
- **Ready issues (4):**
  - **#170** — priority:**high** — Filter conversations by engagement level (`--engaged`, `--min-engaged`) ⬅ picked
  - #161 — priority:medium — `ohtv ask`: prompt-based agent mode + `--agent-tools` rename
  - #162 — priority:medium — Capture `ohtv ask` sessions as on-disk telemetry
  - #173 — priority:low — refactor: reduce nesting in `_load_engagement_for_ids`
- **On hold (2):** #26 (mcp server), #90 (`ohtv label` batch).

**Step 4 — Decision (per orchestrate decision tree):**
- PR slot: `No open PR + ready issues with priority` → **Spawn implementation worker for highest priority (#170, priority:high).** ✅
- Expansion slot: 0 issues need expansion → **stay idle.** ✅

**Step 5 — Spawned: Implementation Worker**
- Issue: [#170 — Filter conversations by engagement level](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/issues/170) (priority:high)
- Start task: `08cc30b0` → `app_conversation_id = 1f83ee25fdc14a199f89b53e96bf138e`
- Conversation: [`1f83ee2`](https://app.all-hands.dev/conversations/1f83ee25fdc14a199f89b53e96bf138e)
- Polling timeline: `WORKING` (T+0s) → `READY` (T+5s). **Fastest spawn-task transition observed this run — single 5s poll.** First-attempt success.
- Verify (T+13s): `execution_status=running`, `sandbox_status=RUNNING`. ✅ Confirmed executing.
- Plugin spec (unchanged, **13th successful spawn**): `{"source": "github:jpshackelford/.openhands", "repo_path": "plugins/ohtv-workflow", "ref": "feat/ohtv-workflow-plugin"}`.
- Spawn payload contract: `initial_message: {content: [{type:"text", text:"…"}], run: true}` (V1 — verified yet again, 13th in a row).
- Auth header: `X-Access-Token: $OPENHANDS_API_KEY` (per `/spawn-conversation` skill).
- Prompt scope: read issue body & comments → branch `feat/170-engagement-filters` from `origin/main` (now at 5124eec, post-#174-release) → implement `parse_duration_to_seconds` + `_filter_by_engagement` reusing PR #171's batched `_load_engagement_for_conversations` → wire `--engaged` / `--no-engaged` / `--min-engaged DURATION` / `--min-engagement-ratio PCT` into `_apply_conversation_filters` (covers `list`, `gen objs`, `gen titles`, `gen run` in one shot) → mutual-exclusion validation → tests per the issue's enumerated AC list → draft PR with `Closes #170` → CI green → ready → WORKLOG entry → EXIT.

**Step 6 — Quiet-cycle check:** Productive cycle (1 worker spawned + PR #174 merge confirmed + release recorded). Auto-disable counter stays at **0**.

**Cycle expectations for next 1–3 cycles (~30–90 min):**
- **Next cycle (~11:20Z):** Most likely —
  - ~55%: Implementation worker `1f83ee2` still running. The #170 surface area is non-trivial (4 flags × 4 commands × mutual-exclusion + duration parser + missing-row semantics + ~12 test cases). Expect 30–75 min of real work.
  - ~30%: Worker finished with a draft PR #175 pushed; CI may or may not be green yet. → Wait (PR worker is the implementation worker still finalizing) OR spawn nothing if PR is ready+green.
  - ~10%: Worker finished, PR ready, CI green, **README not updated** → spawn **docs worker** (high priority — #170 adds 4 new CLI flags × 4 commands = the canonical "user-facing change" trigger).
  - ~5%: Worker hit an unexpected blocker.
- **2 cycles out (~11:50Z):** Most likely PR #175 in the docs → testing pipeline.
- **3 cycles out (~12:20Z):** Testing landed; review or merge in flight; #170 close to merge → engagement family **4/4 done** 🎉.

**Notes / follow-ups carried forward (cumulative):**
- **`initial_message` spawn-payload contract** remains the high-priority pin. **13 successful spawns** in a row with `{"initial_message": {"content": [{"type":"text","text":"…"}], "run": true}}`. Deprecated `initial_user_msg` still never used.
- **Spawn auth header:** `X-Access-Token: $OPENHANDS_API_KEY` (the `/spawn-conversation` skill's documented header). Other endpoints accept `Authorization: Bearer …` — both work against the same key.
- **OpenHands Cloud API gotchas:** `POST /api/v1/app-conversations` (no trailing slash); `start-tasks/search` returns `{"items": […]}`; poll start-task by `id` from the POST response.
- **Tool install pattern:** `uv tool install git+https://github.com/jpshackelford/lxa.git` + same for `ohtv` works cleanly when `site-packages` is read-only — adds `/home/openhands/.local/bin` to PATH. Either `uv venv .venv` (10:20Z) or `uv tool install` (this cycle) gets it done; tool install is slightly cleaner because no venv to source.
- **Engagement-metric family progress: 3/4 done** after this cycle's merge confirmation. #170 implementation in flight → expect 4/4 within 2–3 cycles. Then #161/#162/#173 take over the ready queue.
- **GitHub CLI `--json merged` is not a field.** Use `state == "MERGED"` (and `mergedAt`, `mergeCommit`) instead. Cached.
- **`GH_TOKEN` vs `github_token`:** `GH_TOKEN` was unset, `github_token` was the populated one. `export GH_TOKEN="$github_token"` works. (Inverse of the 10:20Z cycle's "GITHUB_TOKEN populated" note — the available shim flips between cycles; check both.)
- **Release workflow confirmation:** `feat:` squash-merge subject for PR #174 triggered `ohtv-v0.25.0` tag as designed. End-to-end ~2 min from merge to tagged release. No manual intervention.
- **`statusCheckRollup` is the source of truth for "is CI green?"** — `mergeable`/`mergeStateStatus` may show `UNKNOWN` due to GitHub-side cache lag (observed in 10:20Z cycle; not re-triggered this cycle since the PR is now closed).
- **Plugin spec format unchanged:** 13th successful spawn — `{"source": "github:jpshackelford/.openhands", "repo_path": "plugins/ohtv-workflow", "ref": "feat/ohtv-workflow-plugin"}`.

**Local checkout note:** `main` HEAD at `5124eec` on entry (ohtv-v0.25.0 release commit). This entry pushes one more commit on top. No code branches created by the orchestrator — implementation worker `1f83ee2` will create `feat/170-engagement-filters` in its own sandbox.

EXIT per orchestrate skill — next cycle (~30 min) checks `1f83ee2` (implementation worker) and any draft/ready PR #175 it has pushed.

### 2026-06-04 11:20 UTC - Orchestrator

**Active Workers:**

| Conv ID | Type | Working On | Status |
|---------|------|------------|--------|
| `ee9bfd9` | docs | PR #175 — README for engagement filters | **NEW** (running, first poll) |

**Step 0 — Setup:** `uv sync` ran clean in the local checkout (fresh `.venv` since the cloned workspace had no env). `lxa` + `ohtv` resolved from `.venv/bin/`. `lxa repo add jpshackelford/ohtv` was a fresh add (created `Unnamed Board 1` — cosmetic, no behavior impact). `ohtv sync` was slow this cycle (>30s, did not gate any decision) — skipped output; subsequent `gh`/`lxa` calls did all the gating.

**Step 0.5 — Housekeeping:** WORKLOG.md is **1176 lines** at cycle entry. Truncated at 10:20Z (2464 → 943) and the 10:20Z + 10:50Z entries are still inside the 6h productive window. **Defer truncation** — first cycle since the big truncation; counter sits at 0 cycles overdue. Will re-evaluate next cycle.

**Step 1 — Human Instructions:** None pending. `awk` over WORKLOG.md (excluding fenced code blocks) for `^## INSTRUCTION:` → empty.

**Step 2 — Active Workers (pre-this-spawn):** Prior cycle's implementation worker `1f83ee2` reports `execution_status=finished, sandbox_status=RUNNING` → finished. (Also: `002934f` from 10:20Z still `PAUSED, execution_status=null` — finished long ago.) PR slot is **free** for the next handoff. Expansion slot idle.

**Step 3 — State gathered:**
- **PR #175 — `feat(filter): add engagement-level filters to list and gen subcommands`** (closes #170): branch `feat/170-engagement-filters`, opened 11:11Z, last commit 11:10Z, ready (not draft).
- **PR #175 status (lxa-style):** `oR green ready 1 💬` — opened, **R**eviewed by `github-actions` `pr-review` bot (state `COMMENTED`, verdict 🟡 "Acceptable — Clean implementation with comprehensive testing. One minor documentation enhancement suggested"), `lint` + `pytest` both **SUCCESS**, `mergeable=MERGEABLE`, `mergeStateStatus=CLEAN`.
- **PR #175 changed files:** `src/ohtv/cli.py`, `src/ohtv/filters.py`, 4 new test files (`test_filters_duration.py`, `test_cli_engagement_filter.py`, `test_cli_list_engagement_filter.py`, `test_cli_gen_engagement_filter.py`), `uv.lock`. **No `README.md` in the diff** — docs gap confirmed.
- **README scan:** `grep -nE "engagement|--engaged" README.md` → 0 hits. New `--engaged` / `--no-engaged` / `--min-engaged` / `--min-engagement-ratio` flags across `list` + 3 `gen` subcommands are completely undocumented.
- **Open PRs:** 1 (PR #175). **Issues needing expansion:** 0. **Ready issues (4):** #170 (in flight via PR #175), #161 (priority:medium), #162 (priority:medium), #173 (priority:low). On hold: #26, #90.

**Step 4 — Decision (per orchestrate decision tree):**
- PR slot: `PR exists, ready, CI green, **README not updated**` → **Spawn docs worker.** ✅ User-facing surface is 4 new CLI flags × 4 commands — canonical docs trigger. The `pr-review` bot's minor inline comment is deferred to a later review-handler worker (out of scope for the docs worker per the orchestrate workflow sequence "Docs Update → Manual Testing → Review").
- Expansion slot: 0 issues need expansion → **stay idle.** ✅

**Step 5 — Spawned: Docs Worker**
- PR: [#175 — feat(filter): add engagement-level filters](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/pull/175) (closes #170)
- Start task: `d5eb0c17` → `app_conversation_id = ee9bfd9a84474e1e995e7b2d3371d7c6`
- Conversation: [`ee9bfd9`](https://app.all-hands.dev/conversations/ee9bfd9a84474e1e995e7b2d3371d7c6)
- Polling timeline: `WORKING` (T+0s) → `STARTING_CONVERSATION` (T+10s) → `READY` (T+18s). First-attempt success.
- Verify (T+~20s): `execution_status=running`, `sandbox_status=RUNNING`. **Confirmed actually executing.**
- Plugin spec (unchanged, **14th successful spawn**): `{"source": "github:jpshackelford/.openhands", "repo_path": "plugins/ohtv-workflow", "ref": "feat/ohtv-workflow-plugin"}`.
- Spawn payload contract: `initial_message: {content: [{type:"text", text:"…"}], run: true}` (V1 — 14 in a row).
- Auth header: `X-Access-Token: $OPENHANDS_API_KEY`.
- Prompt scope: checkout PR branch → read PR/Issue context → add an "Engagement filtering" section to README.md documenting the 4 flags + 3 copy-pasteable examples + missing-row semantics callout + `conversation_engagement` provenance note → also touch `docs/guides/`/`docs/reference/cli.md` if the existing patterns warrant → commit `docs: …` → push → wait for CI green → post PR comment summarizing the docs changes (with AI-agent disclosure) → WORKLOG entry on main → EXIT. Explicit OUT-OF-SCOPE: inline pr-review bot comment (review-handler's job), manual tests (testing worker next), any `src/`/`tests/` edits.

**Step 6 — Quiet-cycle check:** Productive cycle (1 worker spawned). Auto-disable counter stays at **0**.

**Cycle expectations for next 1–3 cycles (~30–90 min):**
- **Next cycle (~11:50Z):** Most likely —
  - ~50%: Docs worker `ee9bfd9` still running. README edit is small but the worker also has to test examples and may iterate.
  - ~35%: Docs commit pushed, CI green, docs PR comment posted → spawn **testing worker** (PR slot occupied by testing role).
  - ~10%: Docs commit lands but CI flakes / lint trips → wait or spawn fix.
  - ~5%: Worker mis-scopes (touches code) — pr-review will catch on next review pass.
- **2 cycles out (~12:20Z):** Testing worker reporting "ALL TESTS PASS" or surfacing a doc-vs-behavior mismatch (which is the whole point of docs-before-testing). Review worker handles the minor pr-review inline comment in parallel-ish, then merge.
- **3 cycles out (~12:50Z):** PR #175 squash-merged → `ohtv-v0.26.0` (next minor, `feat:` subject) → engagement-metric family **4/4 done** 🎉 → ready queue shifts to #161/#162/#173.

**Notes / follow-ups carried forward (cumulative):**
- **`initial_message` spawn-payload contract** stays pinned. **14 successful spawns** in a row with `{"initial_message": {"content": [{"type":"text","text":"…"}], "run": true}}`.
- **Spawn auth header:** `X-Access-Token: $OPENHANDS_API_KEY` (per `/spawn-conversation` skill).
- **Plugin spec format unchanged:** 14th successful spawn — `{"source": "github:jpshackelford/.openhands", "repo_path": "plugins/ohtv-workflow", "ref": "feat/ohtv-workflow-plugin"}`.
- **`GH_TOKEN` shim:** `GH_TOKEN` was unset this cycle; `GITHUB_TOKEN` and `github_token` both populated. `export GH_TOKEN="${GITHUB_TOKEN:-$github_token}"` worked. The shim keeps flipping between cycles; keep checking both.
- **Tool install pattern:** This cycle used the `uv sync`-installed `.venv` (because the workspace was a fresh clone with no `~/.local/bin/lxa`/`ohtv`). Either `uv tool install` (10:50Z), `uv venv .venv` (10:20Z), or `uv sync` (this cycle) gets it done; pick the one matching the sandbox state.
- **lxa initial board creation** is silent and cosmetic — `lxa repo add` works the same with or without a pre-named board. Not worth fixing.
- **`ohtv sync` can stall >30s** on cold runs even with `--since 4h --quiet`. Don't gate decisions on it — `gh pr list` + `lxa pr list` + `gh issue list` cover the orchestrator state surface independently. Cached follow-up.
- **`pr-review` bot leaves verdicts as `state=COMMENTED` (not `APPROVED`)** when verdict is 🟡 Acceptable with inline suggestions. So `reviewDecision` stays `""` even when the review is positive. Use the review-body verdict tag (🟢/🟡/🔴) as the source of truth for review-handler dispatch. New cached learning this cycle.
- **GitHub CLI `gh pr view --comments` only returns issue-style comments, not review-thread comments.** Use `gh pr view --json reviews` (or GraphQL `pullRequest.reviewThreads`) for review content. Cached.
- **Engagement-metric family progress:** #167 ✅, #168 ✅, #169 ✅, #170 → PR #175 docs-in-flight → expected merge within 2 cycles → 4/4 done.
- **`statusCheckRollup` remains the source of truth for "is CI green?"** Both `lint` and `pytest` SUCCESS on the head commit of `feat/170-engagement-filters`.

**Local checkout note:** `main` HEAD at `2a8eab0` on entry (the prior orchestrator's worklog commit). This entry pushes one more chore(worklog) commit on top. Local `uv.lock` had a 1-line drift from `uv sync` — discarded before rebase. No code branches created by orchestrator.

EXIT per orchestrate skill — next cycle (~30 min) checks `ee9bfd9` (docs worker), the README.md diff on PR #175, the pushed docs commit's CI, and (if all green) spawns the manual-testing worker.

### 2026-06-04 11:25 UTC - Implementation Worker (Issue #170 → PR #175)

✅ **Opened PR [#175](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/pull/175) — `feat(filter): add engagement-level filters to list and gen subcommands` (Closes [#170](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/issues/170)).**

- Branch: `feat/170-engagement-filters` off `main @ 5124eec` (post-#174 merge).
- CI: lint ✓ · pytest ✓ · enable-orchestrator ✓ (1m4s).
- PR marked ready for review.

**What shipped:**
- Four new flags on `ohtv list`, `gen objs`, `gen titles`, `gen run`:
  - `--engaged` — keep rows with `engaged_seconds > 0`.
  - `--no-engaged` — fire-and-forget (missing row OR `engaged_seconds == 0`). Only flag that treats a missing engagement row as *include*.
  - `--min-engaged DURATION` — accepts `5m` / `30s` / `1h` / `1h30m` (case-insensitive) / bare int|float interpreted as minutes (`5` == `5m`).
  - `--min-engagement-ratio PCT` — float `[0, 100]`. Rows with `total_duration_seconds == 0` or NULL excluded.
- Shared decorator `engagement_filter_options` + shared validator `_validate_engagement_filter_args` — both consumed by `_apply_conversation_filters`, so the four call sites share one error path (`click.BadParameter`, exit 2) **before any DB work**.
- New `ohtv.filters.parse_duration_to_seconds(value: str) -> int` — reusable for any future duration parsing.
- Engagement lookup reuses **PR #171's batched** `_load_engagement_for_conversations` — single `WHERE conversation_id IN (?, ?, …)` chunked at 900 IDs. **Zero per-row queries.**
- Engagement filter runs last in `_apply_conversation_filters` (after `--errors-only`), so it composes cleanly with every existing filter (`--repo`, `--pr`, `--action`, `--label`, `--since`, `--until`, `--errors-only`) and every existing display knob (`--with-engagement`, `--reverse`, `--max`, `--include-empty`, `--no-refs`, `--idle`).

**Key decisions (recorded for future readers):**
1. **Bare numeric = minutes, not seconds.** `parse_duration_to_seconds("5") == 300`. Matches the issue body's UX intuition ("`--min-engaged 5` == `--min-engaged 5m`"). Cross-referenced in the helper docstring and locked in by an explicit test (`test_bare_integer_is_minutes`).
2. **Missing-row semantics asymmetric.** `--no-engaged` includes never-processed conversations (fire-and-forget intent); `--engaged` / `--min-engaged` / `--min-engagement-ratio` exclude them ("no data → cannot prove threshold"). Mirrors PR #171's display behavior of rendering `-` for missing rows, but for filtering we have to collapse the tri-state into a binary include/exclude.
3. **Ratio threshold and zero-duration rows.** A row with `total_duration_seconds == 0` or NULL cannot have a defined ratio and is excluded under threshold flags — not silently treated as 0%. Tested explicitly.
4. **`--engaged + --min-engaged` permitted (not an error).** The threshold flag implies engagement; `--engaged` is silently absorbed. Only `--engaged + --no-engaged` and `--no-engaged + threshold flag` raise `BadParameter`.

**Test coverage:**
- 90 new unit + integration tests across four files:
  - `tests/unit/test_filters_duration.py` — 39 unit tests for `parse_duration_to_seconds` (h/m/s combos, bare numerics, case-insensitivity, rejection of negatives / nonsense).
  - `tests/unit/test_cli_engagement_filter.py` — 22 unit tests for the validator + `_filter_by_engagement` per-flag semantics + missing-row table.
  - `tests/unit/test_cli_list_engagement_filter.py` — 19 end-to-end `CliRunner` tests against a seeded SQLite DB (every flag's row set, every composition, mutual-exclusion + duration-parse errors, `--help` text).
  - `tests/unit/test_cli_gen_engagement_filter.py` — 10 integration tests verifying the same flag surface is wired into `gen objs`, `gen titles`, `gen run` (mutual-exclusion + invalid-duration paths + `gen objs --min-engaged 5m` actually shrinks the analysis batch).
- Total: **2 443 unit tests pass**, 2 skipped, 3 xfailed (the cloud-sync behavioral harness xfails per AGENTS.md "Testing" section).

**Out of scope (deferred per the issue body):**
- `--max-engaged DURATION` — easy follow-up if a use case emerges.
- `--sort engaged` — orthogonal to filtering; needs its own issue.
- Auto-running the engagement stage when rows are missing — explicitly out of scope; users should run `ohtv db process all` (or `ohtv sync`, which runs all stages).
- Engagement schema or stage-algorithm changes — Issue #163 / PR #165 territory.

**Engagement-metric family progress:**
- #167 ✅ merged (engagement processing stage + DB column)
- #168 ✅ merged (`--with-engagement` JSON output via PR #172)
- #169 ✅ merged (markdown sub-bullet via PR #174)
- **#170 → PR [#175](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/pull/175) (this PR) — ready for review.**

### 2026-06-04 11:35 UTC - Docs Worker (PR #175)

✅ **Documentation landed for PR [#175](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/pull/175) before manual testing.** Pushed `76828f8` to `feat/170-engagement-filters`; both CI checks (lint + pytest) green.

**Scope:** `README.md` + `docs/guides/exploration.md` + `docs/guides/analysis.md` + `docs/reference/cli.md`. No code touched (per task brief — `src/` and `tests/` are explicitly out of scope for this worker).

**What changed:**
- **README.md** — new top-level **Engagement filtering** section (between *Commands* and *Configuration*) with the 4-flag table, mutual-exclusion summary, 4 copy-pasteable examples on `list`/`gen objs`/`gen titles`, an explicit missing-row semantics callout for `--no-engaged`, and a prerequisite pointer to the `engagement` indexing stage (#163 / #165). One-line feature bullet added near the top of the README.
- **docs/guides/exploration.md** — 4 new flag rows in the `ohtv list` Options table; new dedicated **Engagement filters** subsection right after **Engagement columns** with the full missing-row truth table, `--min-engaged` duration grammar (incl. the `5` ≡ `5m` ≠ `5s` trap from the issue's UX rationale), mutual-exclusion rules, and 5 examples. Rewrote the prior "filtering is deferred to #170" deferral notice (was sitting under the `--with-engagement` subsection) to point at the now-shipped subsection.
- **docs/guides/analysis.md** — 4 new flag rows in `gen objs` (multi-conversation), `gen titles`, and `gen run` Options tables; new **Engagement filters** subsection with `gen`-specific examples. Rewrote the matching "deferred to #170" deferral notice.
- **docs/reference/cli.md** — extended the `ohtv list` / `gen objs` / `gen titles` / `gen run` rows to mention the new filter flags and deep-link to the relevant guide subsection.

**Quality bar (per task brief):**
- Every example in the README and both guides was executed against a fresh `OHTV_DIR` on the PR branch (`uv sync` clean). All commands parse, validate, mutually-exclude correctly, and exit 0.
- Caught one issue-body bug during the example pass: the original issue #170 used `--since 30d` / `--since 7d` shorthand — that syntax is wired into `ohtv ask` (RAG temporal filter) only, NOT `--since` on `list`/`gen` (which only accept `today` + ISO date via `click.DateTime`). Docs use `-D N` (last N days) and `--week` instead, both of which work today. Worth flagging if anyone wants `--since 7d` to actually work on `list` — that's a separate issue.
- Style matches the existing `--with-engagement` documentation: same anchor naming (`<a id="engagement-filters-...">`), same "Composes with other flags" / "Prerequisite" phrasing, same per-command Options-table row format.
- No invented doc surface. No duplicate engagement explanations — all four docs cross-reference the same canonical subsection in exploration.md.
- The inline review comment from the `github-actions` `pr-review` bot is intentionally NOT addressed (per task brief — review-handler worker's scope, not docs worker's).

**PR comment posted:** [#175 (comment) 4621720085](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/pull/175#issuecomment-4621720085) — summarizes the four edited files with the AI-agent disclosure line.

**Next worker:** manual testing on a populated `OHTV_DIR` (separate conversation). Testers should verify documented behavior matches actual behavior on real data — in particular the `--no-engaged` missing-row semantics, the `--min-engaged 5 == 5m` duration trap, and the mutual-exclusion exit codes.

### 2026-06-04 11:50 UTC - Orchestrator

**Active Workers:**

| Conv ID | Type | Working On | Status |
|---------|------|------------|--------|
| `325ebc8` | testing | PR #175 — engagement filters manual test | **NEW** (running, first poll) |

**Step 0 — Setup:** `pip install --user git+…/lxa.git git+…/ohtv.git` (system Python had `~/.local/bin` writable this cycle — neither `uv venv` nor `uv tool install` needed). Added `~/.local/bin` to PATH. `lxa repo add` was a fresh add (cosmetic board creation, no behavior impact). `ohtv sync` skipped this cycle — `gh pr list` + `gh issue list` + `lxa pr list` cover all state-gating needs.

**Step 0.5 — Housekeeping:** WORKLOG.md is **1270 lines** at cycle entry (last truncation 10:20Z, 1.5h ago). Still inside the 6-hour productive window for every entry (10:22 merge → 10:50 spawn → 11:20 orchestrator → 11:25 impl → 11:35 docs). **Defer truncation one more cycle** — aggressive truncation would preserve all current entries anyway, so no urgency, and this cycle is already productive (spawning testing worker). Will re-evaluate next cycle once the 10:22Z merge entry ages past the cutoff.

**Step 1 — Human Instructions:** None pending. `awk` over WORKLOG.md (excluding fenced code blocks) for `^## INSTRUCTION:` → empty.

**Step 2 — Active Workers (pre-this-spawn):** Prior cycle's docs worker `ee9bfd9` reports `execution_status=finished, sandbox_status=RUNNING` → **finished**. PR slot is **free** for the next handoff. Expansion slot has been idle for many cycles.

**Step 3 — State gathered:**
- **PR #175 — `feat(filter): add engagement-level filters to list and gen subcommands`** (closes #170): branch `feat/170-engagement-filters`, last commit `76828f8` (docs commit) at 11:28Z, ready (not draft).
- **PR #175 status:** `oRF green ready` — opened, **R**eviewed (🟡 by `pr-review` bot earlier, one minor inline), **F**ixes pushed (docs commit), CI green (`lint` SUCCESS @ 11:28:34Z, `pytest` SUCCESS @ 11:29:38Z). `mergeable=UNKNOWN`/`mergeStateStatus=UNKNOWN` (GitHub-side cache lag — `statusCheckRollup` is the source of truth, cached learning carries forward).
- **PR #175 changed files (post-docs commit):** `README.md`, `docs/guides/analysis.md`, `docs/guides/exploration.md`, `docs/reference/cli.md`, `src/ohtv/cli.py`, `src/ohtv/filters.py`, 4 new test files, `uv.lock`. **README.md present in diff** — docs gap closed.
- **PR comment confirms docs:** `jpshackelford` (the docs worker pushed under that identity) posted **"Documentation updated for PR #175."** at 11:30:06Z, summarizing the 4 edited doc files.
- **Manual test results scan:** `gh pr view 175 --json comments --jq '.comments[] | select(.body | test("Manual Test Results"; "i"))'` → empty. **No manual test results yet.**
- **Open PRs:** 1 (PR #175). **Issues needing expansion:** 0. **Ready issues (4):** #170 (in flight via PR #175), #161 (priority:medium), #162 (priority:medium), #173 (priority:low). On hold: #26, #90.

**Step 4 — Decision (per orchestrate decision tree):**
- PR slot: `PR exists, ready, CI green, docs updated, **no manual test results**` → **Spawn testing worker.** ✅ Even though `pr-review` bot already left a 🟡 inline comment, per the orchestrate skill explicitly: *"Testing step is NOT skipped just because review started. CI must be green to test."* — and CI is green on the docs head commit.
- Expansion slot: 0 issues need expansion → **stay idle.** ✅

**Step 5 — Spawned: Testing Worker**
- PR: [#175 — feat(filter): add engagement-level filters](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/pull/175) (closes #170)
- Start task: `456f43e2` → `app_conversation_id = 325ebc8107c149248fffb92b06490188`
- Conversation: [`325ebc8`](https://app.all-hands.dev/conversations/325ebc8107c149248fffb92b06490188)
- Polling timeline: `STARTING_CONVERSATION` (T+7s) → `READY` (T+14s). **2-poll spawn — second-fastest observed.** First-attempt success.
- Verify (T+~20s): `execution_status=running`, `sandbox_status=RUNNING`. **Confirmed actually executing.**
- Plugin spec (unchanged, **15th successful spawn**): `{"source": "github:jpshackelford/.openhands", "repo_path": "plugins/ohtv-workflow", "ref": "feat/ohtv-workflow-plugin"}`.
- Spawn payload contract: `initial_message: {content: [{type:"text", text:"…"}], run: true}` (V1 — 15 in a row).
- Auth header: `X-Access-Token: $OPENHANDS_API_KEY`.
- Prompt scope: clone + `gh pr checkout 175` → `uv sync` → run on a real populated `OHTV_DIR` (ensure `ohtv db process all` covers the `engagement` stage) → execute the enumerated blackbox checks (mutual-exclusion exit code 2, duration grammar incl. `5` ≡ `5m`, invalid-duration BEFORE-DB rejection, asymmetric missing-row semantics for `--no-engaged` vs all other flags, composition with `--repo`/`--pr`/`--since`/`-D N`/`--errors-only`/`--include-empty`, zero-duration ratio handling, cross-command surface on all 4 commands, performance non-regression vs batched `_load_engagement_for_conversations`) → `uv run pytest -q` for unit-test count → post `## Manual Test Results` PR comment with AI-agent disclosure → WORKLOG entry on `main` → EXIT. Explicit OUT-OF-SCOPE: pr-review bot's inline comment, code changes, doc changes.

**Step 6 — Quiet-cycle check:** Productive cycle (1 worker spawned + docs-worker completion confirmed). Auto-disable counter stays at **0**.

**Cycle expectations for next 1–3 cycles (~30–90 min):**
- **Next cycle (~12:20Z):** Most likely —
  - ~55%: Testing worker `325ebc8` still running. Real-data testing on `~/.ohtv/` with the full engagement stage processed + 9 enumerated checks + 2 443+ unit tests is real work. Expect 25–60 min.
  - ~25%: Test report posted (ALL PASS or PARTIAL PASS) → PR has both reviews AND test results → spawn **review worker** to address the pr-review bot's minor inline comment.
  - ~10%: Test report surfaces a real bug → wait for next orchestrator cycle to decide between review-handler or implementation-fix worker.
  - ~5%: Worker hits an infra issue (cloud sync stall, etc.) and exits without a report → re-spawn next cycle.
  - ~5%: Worker overruns into the review-handler scope.
- **2 cycles out (~12:50Z):** Review handler addresses the 🟡 inline comment, PR ready for merge.
- **3 cycles out (~13:20Z):** PR #175 squash-merged → `ohtv-v0.26.0` (`feat:` subject auto-bumps minor) → engagement-metric family **4/4 done** 🎉 → ready queue shifts to #161/#162/#173. Expansion slot still idle (0 issues need expansion).

**Notes / follow-ups carried forward (cumulative):**
- **`initial_message` spawn-payload contract** stays pinned. **15 successful spawns** in a row with `{"initial_message": {"content": [{"type":"text","text":"…"}], "run": true}}`. Never use deprecated `initial_user_msg`.
- **Spawn auth header:** `X-Access-Token: $OPENHANDS_API_KEY`. Other endpoints accept `Authorization: Bearer $OPENHANDS_API_KEY` — both work.
- **Plugin spec format unchanged:** 15th successful spawn — `{"source": "github:jpshackelford/.openhands", "repo_path": "plugins/ohtv-workflow", "ref": "feat/ohtv-workflow-plugin"}`.
- **`GH_TOKEN` shim:** This cycle `GH_TOKEN` was unset; `GITHUB_TOKEN` populated, `github_token` populated. `export GH_TOKEN="${GITHUB_TOKEN:-$github_token}"` worked. The shim keeps flipping between cycles — check both, always.
- **Tool install pattern (cycle-dependent):** This cycle `pip install --user …` worked because `~/.local/bin` was writable. Previous cycles used `uv venv .venv` (10:20Z), `uv tool install` (10:50Z), or `uv sync` (11:20Z). Try plain `pip install --user` first — fastest path when it works.
- **`ohtv sync` can stall >30s** on cold runs even with `--since 4h --quiet`. Don't gate decisions on it — `gh pr list` + `lxa pr list` + `gh issue list` cover state independently. Skipped this cycle.
- **`pr-review` bot leaves verdicts as `state=COMMENTED` (not `APPROVED`)** when verdict is 🟡 Acceptable with inline suggestions → `reviewDecision` stays empty even when review is positive. Use the verdict tag (🟢/🟡/🔴) as the source of truth for review-handler dispatch.
- **`gh pr view --comments` only returns issue-style comments, not review-thread comments.** Use `gh pr view --json reviews` (or GraphQL `pullRequest.reviewThreads`) for review content. Cached.
- **Engagement-metric family progress:** #167 ✅, #168 ✅, #169 ✅, #170 → PR #175 testing-in-flight → expected merge within 2 cycles → **4/4 done** 🎉.
- **`statusCheckRollup` remains the source of truth for "is CI green?"** Both `lint` and `pytest` SUCCESS on the head commit `76828f8` (docs commit) of `feat/170-engagement-filters`.
- **Worklog truncation policy:** prefer to defer when the productive 6h window still covers all entries (aggressive truncation preserves them anyway); run when the file is both >1500 lines AND the cycle is otherwise non-productive.

**Local checkout note:** `main` HEAD at `4077c70` on entry (the docs worker's worklog commit, which is also the only ref the shallow grafted clone has). This entry pushes one more chore(worklog) commit on top. No code branches created by orchestrator.

EXIT per orchestrate skill — next cycle (~30 min) checks `325ebc8` (testing worker), the PR #175 comments for a `## Manual Test Results` entry, and (if a clean test report exists) spawns the review-handler worker to address the pr-review bot's 🟡 inline comment.

### 2026-06-04 12:18 UTC - Orchestrator

**Active Workers:**

| Conv ID | Type | Working On | Status |
|---------|------|------------|--------|
| `e408d8c` | review | PR #175 — engagement filters (1 thread to resolve) | **NEW** (running, first poll) |

**Step 0 — Setup:** Fresh workspace clone; `uv tool install` of both `lxa` and `ohtv` from GitHub succeeded (system `pip install --system` was blocked by perms — `uv tool` is the right pattern for this sandbox shape). Tools added to `PATH=/home/openhands/.local/bin:$PATH`. `lxa repo add jpshackelford/ohtv` no-op (already present). Skipped `ohtv sync` — `gh` + GraphQL covered every gating signal this cycle.

**Step 0.5 — Housekeeping:** WORKLOG.md is **1373 lines** at entry (>300 threshold by ~4.6×). Prior cycle (11:20Z) explicitly deferred truncation as "first cycle since big truncation, counter 0". **Defer again this cycle** — only one productive entry has landed since the last truncation (testing worker 12:06Z), so the 6h productive-window guard would protect almost everything anyway. Counter at **1 cycle overdue**. Next orchestrator cycle should run `/truncate-worklog` unconditionally.

**Step 1 — Human Instructions:** None. `grep -B1 -A5 "^## INSTRUCTION:" WORKLOG.md` → empty.

**Step 2 — Active Workers (pre-this-spawn):** Polled `app-conversations/search?limit=50`:
- Docs worker `ee9bfd9` (spawned 11:20Z): `exec=null, sandbox=PAUSED` → **finished** (commit `76828f8` at 11:28Z landed: README.md + docs/guides/{analysis,exploration}.md + docs/reference/cli.md).
- Testing worker (12:06Z report) — not separately listed under a known ID but per the worklog entry it self-terminated after posting test report.
- `cf15e8a` is `running` but `created_at=2026-06-04T12:15:46Z` → **this orchestrator conversation itself**, not a worker. Ignored.
- → Both PR slot and expansion slot **free**.

**Step 3 — State gathered:**
- **PR #175 — `feat(filter): add engagement-level filters to list and gen subcommands`** (closes #170): branch `feat/170-engagement-filters`, HEAD `76828f8` (last commit 11:28:20Z), **ready** (not draft).
- **PR #175 CI:** `lint` SUCCESS, `pytest` SUCCESS (statusCheckRollup).
- **PR #175 docs status:** `README.md`, `docs/guides/analysis.md`, `docs/guides/exploration.md`, `docs/reference/cli.md` all in the diff. **Docs updated.** ✅
- **PR #175 manual test status:** Testing worker posted 12:06Z (comment `4621960813`): **ALL PASS** against HEAD `76828f8`. 2492 unit tests pass. Test surface covered mutex / duration grammar / missing-row asymmetry / ratio+zero-duration / composition with `--repo`/`--pr`/`--since`/`-D`/`--include-empty`/`--errors-only` / format-independence (table/json/csv) / all 4 commands (`list`, `gen objs`, `gen titles`, `gen run`) / batched 1-IN-query SQL. Test results match current HEAD → **not outdated**. ✅
- **Open review threads: 1** (`PRRT_kwDOR9seq86HDUYb`, unresolved, isOutdated=false). Author `github-actions` (pr-review bot), on `src/ohtv/cli.py:2318`, verdict 🟡 Acceptable. Suggests adding an "AND-composition" sentence to `--min-engaged` and `--min-engagement-ratio` help text. The pr-review bot's overall review body remains `state=COMMENTED` (not APPROVED), so `reviewDecision=""` — exactly the pattern cached in the prior worklog. Verdict tag in body is the source of truth.
- **Open PRs:** 1 (PR #175). **Issues needing expansion:** 0. **Ready issues (4):** #170 (in flight via PR #175), #161 (priority:medium), #162 (priority:medium), #173 (priority:low). On hold: #26, #90.

**Step 4 — Decision (per orchestrate decision tree):**
- PR slot: `PR exists, ready, CI green, test results valid, 💬 > 0` → **Spawn review worker.** ✅
- Expansion slot: 0 issues need expansion → **stay idle.** ✅

**Step 5 — Spawned: Review Worker**
- PR: [#175 — feat(filter): engagement filters](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/pull/175)
- Start task: `66782bfd` → `app_conversation_id = e408d8c85617488f80a612e44e86545c`
- Conversation: [`e408d8c`](https://app.all-hands.dev/conversations/e408d8c85617488f80a612e44e86545c)
- Polling timeline: posted at ~12:17Z, polled at ~12:18Z → `status=READY` on first poll (well under the typical 18s `WORKING→READY` window — task picker was warm).
- Verify (T+~30s): `execution_status=running`, `sandbox_status=RUNNING`. **Confirmed actually executing.**
- Plugin spec (unchanged, **15th successful spawn**): `{"source": "github:jpshackelford/.openhands", "repo_path": "plugins/ohtv-workflow", "ref": "feat/ohtv-workflow-plugin"}`.
- Spawn payload contract: `initial_message: {content: [{type:"text", text:"…"}], run: true}` (V1 — 15 in a row).
- Auth header: `X-Access-Token: $OPENHANDS_API_KEY`.
- **Prompt scope:** undraft PR → accept the bot's suggestion (orchestrator's read: small, helpful, no scope creep) → add AND-composition sentence to BOTH `--min-engaged` and `--min-engagement-ratio` help text across all 4 commands where they appear → `uv run pytest -q && uv run ruff check src tests` → commit with `docs(cli):` subject (release-safe — won't compete with the PR's overall `feat:` squash subject) → push → wait CI green → reply to thread `PRRT_kwDOR9seq86HDUYb` with commit SHA + resolve via GraphQL → re-ready PR → WORKLOG entry on main → EXIT. **Explicit OUT-OF-SCOPE:** README/docs (already complete), manual re-test (help-text change is below the "significant changes" heuristic), squash/merge.

**Step 6 — Quiet-cycle check:** Productive cycle (1 worker spawned). Auto-disable counter stays at **0**.

**Cycle expectations for next 1–3 cycles (~30–90 min):**
- **Next cycle (~12:48Z):** Most likely —
  - ~55%: Review worker `e408d8c` still running (help-text edit is trivial but PR-undraft + GraphQL thread-resolve dance + waiting for CI takes a few minutes).
  - ~30%: Review fix pushed, CI green, thread resolved, PR back to ready → spawn **merge worker** (help-text-only change → no re-test, no docs spot-check needed per the AGENTS-style heuristics).
  - ~10%: pr-review bot files a follow-up round on the help-text wording → another review worker.
  - ~5%: Worker mis-scopes (re-edits docs/tests) — minor noise, won't block.
- **2 cycles out (~13:18Z):** PR #175 squash-merged → `ohtv-v0.26.0` (next minor, `feat:` subject) → engagement-metric family **4/4 done** 🎉 → ready queue shifts to #161/#162/#173.
- **3 cycles out (~13:48Z):** Implementation worker for the highest-priority remaining ready issue. None are `priority:high` after #170 closes — #161/#162 are `priority:medium`, #173 is `priority:low`. Orchestrator will run `/assess-priority` inline if no `priority:high` lands by then.

**Notes / follow-ups carried forward (cumulative):**
- **`initial_message` spawn-payload contract** stays pinned. **15 successful spawns** in a row with `{"initial_message": {"content": [{"type":"text","text":"…"}], "run": true}}`.
- **Spawn auth header:** `X-Access-Token: $OPENHANDS_API_KEY`.
- **Plugin spec format unchanged.**
- **Start-task polling endpoint:** `GET /api/v1/app-conversations/start-tasks/search` (the bare `start-task/{id}` path returns the SPA HTML — not an error, just the wrong endpoint). Cached so future cycles don't waste polls.
- **`GH_TOKEN` shim:** `GH_TOKEN` was unset this cycle; `GITHUB_TOKEN` and `github_token` both populated. `export GH_TOKEN="${GITHUB_TOKEN:-$github_token}"` worked. Shim keeps flipping between cycles; keep checking both.
- **Tool install pattern (refined):** This cycle used `uv tool install git+https://github.com/jpshackelford/{lxa,ohtv}.git`. System-wide `uv pip install --system` was blocked by `/usr/local/lib/python3.13/site-packages` perms (matches prior cycles' findings). `uv tool install` is the most reliable fresh-clone pattern for this sandbox shape; `uv sync` works when the local checkout has a usable `pyproject.toml` (it does).
- **PR-review bot verdict-vs-state mismatch:** the bot leaves overall review `state=COMMENTED` (not APPROVED) even on 🟡 Acceptable verdicts. So `reviewDecision` stays `""`. Use the 🟢/🟡/🔴 tag in the review body as source of truth for review-handler dispatch. Confirmed again this cycle.
- **Review threads vs PR comments:** `gh pr view --comments` only returns issue-style comments. Use `gh api graphql … reviewThreads` to read review threads, and the same GraphQL mutations to reply/resolve them. Cached.
- **WORKLOG truncation:** 1373 lines, deferred once more, counter at **1 cycle overdue**. Next cycle should run `/truncate-worklog` unconditionally.
- **Engagement-metric family progress:** #167 ✅, #168 ✅, #169 ✅, #170 → PR #175 review-in-flight → expected merge within 1–2 cycles → 4/4 done.

**Local checkout note:** `main` HEAD at `1bed76f` on entry (testing worker's 12:06Z worklog commit). This entry pushes one more `chore(worklog)` commit on top. No code branches created by orchestrator.

EXIT per orchestrate skill — next cycle (~30 min) checks `e408d8c` (review worker), the pushed docs/cli commit's CI, the resolution status of thread `PRRT_kwDOR9seq86HDUYb`, and (if all green and no new threads) spawns the merge worker.

### 2026-06-04 12:25 UTC - Review Worker (PR #175, round 1)

**Worker Type:** review
**PR:** [#175 — feat(filter): engagement-level filters](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/pull/175)
**Branch:** `feat/170-engagement-filters`
**Commit:** `7a067f7`

**Single thread addressed:** `PRRT_kwDOR9seq86HDUYb` (🟡 Acceptable) — bot suggested
documenting AND-composition of `--min-engaged` + `--min-engagement-ratio` in
`--help`. Accepted the suggestion (small, helpful, no scope creep). Added a
sentence to both flags' help text in the shared
`engagement_filter_options` decorator so all four commands (`list`,
`gen objs`, `gen titles`, `gen run`) get the update from one site.

**Test impact:** None. The existing `test_both_thresholds_must_both_pass`
already locks the AND-composition behavior, and no tests assert on
help-text substrings.

**CI status (post-push):** lint ✓ · pytest ✓ (2492 passed, 2 skipped, 3 xfailed)

**Thread state:** Replied and resolved via GraphQL.
**PR state:** Moved back from draft → ready for review.

Next cycle should check for any follow-up review comments; otherwise the
re-test heuristic should pass-through (help-text-only change is not
significant per orchestrator policy) and dispatch a merge worker.

### 2026-06-04 12:50 UTC - Orchestrator

**Active Workers:**

| Conv ID | Type | Working On | Status |
|---------|------|------------|--------|
| `d7b3f7c` | merge | PR #175 — engagement filters squash-merge | **NEW** (running, verified) |

**Step 0 — Setup:** Fresh workspace clone. `uv pip install --system` blocked by perms (matches prior cycles' findings); fell back to `pip install --user`, which placed both binaries in `~/.local/bin` — added to `PATH`. `lxa repo add` re-created an "Unnamed Board 1" (cosmetic, board persistence is per-sandbox), no behavior impact. Skipped `ohtv sync` — `gh` covers every gating signal this cycle.

**Step 0.5 — Housekeeping:** WORKLOG.md was **1476 lines** at cycle entry. Prior cycle counter was "1 cycle overdue, run unconditionally". **Truncation executed** — 19 entries scanned (8 productive, 11 status); cutoff `2026-06-04T06:21Z`; archived 7 entries to `WORKLOG_ARCHIVE_2026-06-04.md` (now 841 lines on that file, the rest landed earlier); WORKLOG.md down to 681 lines pre-this-entry. Counter reset to **0**.

**Step 1 — Human Instructions:** None. `grep -B1 -A5 "^## INSTRUCTION:" WORKLOG.md` → empty.

**Step 2 — Active Workers (pre-this-spawn):** Polled `app-conversations/search?limit=50`:
- Review worker `e408d8c` (spawned 12:17Z): `execution_status=finished, sandbox_status=RUNNING` → **finished**. Sandbox auto-pauses after the agent exits; status=finished is the source of truth.
- `cf15e8a`: prior orchestrator cycle, `sandbox_status=MISSING` → ignored.
- → PR slot **free**; expansion slot **free**.

**Step 3 — State gathered:**
- **PR #175 — `feat(filter): add engagement-level filters to list and gen subcommands`** (closes #170): branch `feat/170-engagement-filters`, HEAD `7a067f7` (review-fix commit at 12:25Z), **ready** (not draft).
- **PR #175 CI:** `lint` ✓, `pytest` ✓, `pr-review` ✓, `enable-orchestrator` ✓ — all SUCCESS @ HEAD `7a067f7`.
- **PR #175 review:** `reviewDecision: APPROVED` 🟢 (pr-review bot's final review on the help-text-clarification commit). Notable shift from the long-running pattern where the bot leaves `state=COMMENTED` — this time it actually APPROVED. Cached learning carries forward: bot can swing either way; treat APPROVED as merge-ready, treat COMMENTED + 🟢/🟡 tag in body as merge-ready too.
- **PR #175 review threads:** 1 total, **0 unresolved**. Thread `PRRT_kwDOR9seq86HDUYb` was resolved by the review worker at 12:25Z with reply pointing to commit `7a067f7`.
- **PR #175 docs status:** README + 3 docs files in the diff (docs worker @ 11:28Z). **Docs updated.** ✅
- **PR #175 manual test status:** Testing worker posted 12:06Z (comment `4621960813`): **ALL PASS** against HEAD `76828f8`. Diff `76828f8...7a067f7` = 1 commit (`docs(cli): clarify engagement threshold AND-composition in help text`), 1 file (`src/ohtv/cli.py`, +6/-4) — help-text-only Click decorator strings, no runtime behavior change. **Below "significant changes" re-test heuristic per orchestrate skill** (line: "Do NOT re-test if only… Comments or docstrings changed"). Test results remain **valid**. ✅
- **Side observation:** PR #176 (`docs: Add engagement threshold empirical tuning analysis`) merged externally during the prior cycle (`86c3750` on `origin/main`). Doc-only, no impact on PR #175. Mentioned for chain-of-custody.
- **Open PRs:** 1 (PR #175). **Issues needing expansion:** 0. **Ready issues (3 remaining after #170 merges):** #161 (priority:medium), #162 (priority:medium), #173 (priority:low). On hold: #26, #90.

**Step 4 — Decision (per orchestrate decision tree):**
- PR slot: `PR exists, ready, CI green, test results valid, 0 unresolved threads, APPROVED` → **Spawn merge worker.** ✅
  - Docs spot-check not required: only delta since last docs/test is a 10-line help-text clarification that *reinforces* the AND-composition behavior already documented in README. Per orchestrate skill: docs spot-check is for "significant review changes that may have affected documented behavior" — this delta is below the bar.
  - Re-test not required: see Step 3 analysis.
- Expansion slot: 0 issues need expansion → **stay idle.** ✅

**Step 5 — Spawned: Merge Worker**
- PR: [#175 — feat(filter): engagement filters](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/pull/175)
- Start task: `8f0c39ef` → `app_conversation_id = d7b3f7c23a3d4bb2a8a11a8a23d80ed6` → **READY** on first poll (~25s; typical warm-picker latency)
- Conversation: [`d7b3f7c`](https://app.all-hands.dev/conversations/d7b3f7c23a3d4bb2a8a11a8a23d80ed6)
- Verified `execution_status=running, sandbox_status=RUNNING` ~30s after spawn.
- Plugin spec (unchanged, **16th successful spawn**): `{"source": "github:jpshackelford/.openhands", "repo_path": "plugins/ohtv-workflow", "ref": "feat/ohtv-workflow-plugin"}`.
- Spawn payload contract (unchanged, V1): `initial_message: {content: [{type:"text", text:"…"}], run: true}`.
- Auth header: `X-Access-Token: $OPENHANDS_API_KEY`.
- **Prompt scope:** checkout PR → review diff holistically → update PR description if needed (final-state summary) → squash-merge keeping PR title `feat(filter): add engagement-level filters to list and gen subcommands` (semantic-release → minor bump → `ohtv-v0.26.0`) → verify merge state + release workflow kicks off → `chore(worklog):` WORKLOG update on main → EXIT. **Explicit OUT-OF-SCOPE:** changing the squash subject prefix, pushing code to main, re-testing, docs spot-check.
- **Endpoint hiccup caught & cached:** First spawn attempt used `POST /api/v1/app-conversations/start-tasks` (plural) → `405 Method Not Allowed`. Correct endpoint is `POST /api/v1/app-conversations` (the start-task object is the *response*, not the request path). The `start-tasks/search` GET endpoint is for polling status only. Cached this for future cycles.

**Step 6 — Quiet-cycle check:** Productive cycle (1 worker spawned + truncation executed). Auto-disable counter stays at **0**.

**Cycle expectations for next 1–3 cycles (~30–90 min):**
- **Next cycle (~13:20Z):** Most likely —
  - ~70%: Merge worker `d7b3f7c` has finished, PR #175 is **merged**, release workflow has tagged `ohtv-v0.26.0` and published the GitHub Release. Engagement-metric family **4/4 done** 🎉. Orchestrator runs `/assess-priority` inline (no `priority:high` ready issues left) and spawns implementation worker for next ready issue (likely #161 or #162, both `priority:medium`).
  - ~20%: Merge worker still running (squash + release workflow can take 1–2 min for the auto-commit to push back to main; orchestrator should treat slot as occupied).
  - ~7%: Merge encountered a stale-branch issue (PR #176 landed externally on main between testing and merge — though that was a docs-only commit so no semantic conflict expected). Worker may need a rebase/merge resolution.
  - ~3%: GitHub merge queue or branch protection caught something the gh API didn't surface.
- **2 cycles out (~13:50Z):** Implementation worker on the highest-priority ready issue. If #161 and #162 are both `priority:medium`, orchestrator picks the lowest number (#161) per FIFO convention.
- **3 cycles out (~14:20Z):** Either PR #161/#162 in flight, or — if implementation worker hit something nontrivial — still in implementation phase.

**Notes / follow-ups carried forward (cumulative):**
- **`initial_message` spawn-payload contract** stays pinned. **16 successful spawns** in a row with `{"initial_message": {"content": [{"type":"text","text":"…"}], "run": true}}`.
- **Spawn auth header:** `X-Access-Token: $OPENHANDS_API_KEY`.
- **Plugin spec format unchanged.**
- **Start-task POST endpoint:** `POST /api/v1/app-conversations` (NOT `…/start-tasks`). The response IS a start-task object. Cached after this cycle's 405.
- **Start-task polling endpoint:** `GET /api/v1/app-conversations/start-tasks/search`.
- **`GH_TOKEN` shim:** worked again this cycle via `export GH_TOKEN="${GITHUB_TOKEN:-$github_token}"`.
- **Tool install pattern:** This cycle `pip install --user` worked (was previously blocked); `uv tool install` also works when needed. Either is fine; prefer `pip install --user` for speed unless perms block it.
- **PR-review bot:** can leave APPROVED OR COMMENTED-with-tag verdicts. Both are merge-ready signals. This cycle saw the APPROVED path.
- **Review threads vs PR comments:** `gh pr view --comments` only returns issue-style comments. Use `gh api graphql … reviewThreads` for review threads.
- **WORKLOG truncation:** ran this cycle, counter reset to 0. Next truncation when WORKLOG > 300 lines again (currently 681 + this entry).
- **Engagement-metric family progress:** #167 ✅, #168 ✅, #169 ✅, #170 → PR #175 merge-in-flight → expected 4/4 done within 1 cycle.

**Local checkout note:** `main` HEAD at `86c3750` on entry. This entry commits truncation (archive file + slim WORKLOG.md) + this cycle entry as `chore(worklog):`. No code branches touched by orchestrator.

EXIT per orchestrate skill — next cycle (~30 min) checks `d7b3f7c` (merge worker), PR #175 state (expect `merged`), `ohtv-v0.26.0` release on GitHub, and (if all green) dispatches an implementation worker for the next priority-medium ready issue.
