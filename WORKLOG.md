### 2026-05-30 10:24 UTC - Merge worker (PR #155)

**Merged**: [PR #155](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/pull/155) — `feat(list,refs): roots-only by default with subtree rollup (#127)`
- **Merge SHA**: `5c0adfb3b551dd2dd18d48107dd440b3e04a3d53`
- **Released**: [`ohtv-v0.18.0`](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/releases/tag/ohtv-v0.18.0) (release commit `67bcb89`, ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES)
- **Auto-release**: `chore(release): ohtv 0.18.0 [skip ci]` landed at 2026-05-30T10:23:50Z (~2 min after merge). semantic-release picked up the `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer and the `major_on_zero = false` config — minor bump to v0.18.0 (not v1.0.0), CHANGELOG carries the `⚠ BREAKING CHANGES` section per the v0.17.0 precedent.

**What shipped** (the user-facing flip):
- `ohtv list` defaults to roots-only; `--include-sub-conversations` restores per-sub rendering.
- `ohtv refs -D` (multi-conv form) defaults to roots-only; `--include-sub-conversations` opt-back-in.
- `ohtv refs <root-id>` now rolls up the entire delegation subtree (union, dedup by URL).
- `ohtv refs <sub-id>` and `ohtv show <id>` unchanged — single-conv paths preserved.
- Filter routing on `list` (`--pr`, `--repo`, `--label`, `--action`) goes through `expand_to_roots` so a PR/repo touched only by a delegated sub surfaces the matching **root** row.
- Migration-020 (`root_conversation_id`) guardrail fires inline on the new code paths (refs subtree + list date range) with a friendly `ohtv db scan` hint.

**Tests**: +19 (8 `TestExpandToRoots` in `test_filters.py`; 11 across `TestFilterByPrRootExpansion` / `TestRefsSubtreeRollup` / `TestMigration020Guardrail` / `TestCliOptionSurface` in new `test_cli_list_refs_subs.py`). Suite: 2082 passed, 2 skipped, 3 xfailed.

**Cluster snapshot (#122 root-grain rollout):**

| Issue | Command | Status |
|---|---|---|
| #123 | `report weekly-counts` | ✅ PR #150 → v0.16.1 |
| #124 | `report velocity` | ✅ PR #153 → v0.16.2 |
| #125 | `gen objs / titles / run` | ✅ PR #154 → v0.17.0 ⚠ BREAKING |
| **#127** | **`list` / `refs`** | **✅ PR #155 → v0.18.0 ⚠ BREAKING** |
| #128 | RAG `ask` / `search` citation dedup | ⏳ Remaining — last leg of cluster |

The cluster pattern is now codified across four shipped PRs: flag-threaded `include_subs` predicate (default False) + DB-layer COALESCE + migration-020 guardrail + `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer for the default-flip surfaces. #128 is expected to follow the same shape on the RAG citation surface.

**No AGENTS.md edits** per cluster convention — the AGENTS.md item is owned by the #122 umbrella, not per-issue PRs.

### 2026-05-30 07:55 UTC - Implementation worker (#127 list/refs root grain)

✅ **Opened PR #155** — `feat(list,refs): roots-only by default with subtree rollup (#127)`

- **PR**: [#155](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/pull/155) — `feat/list-refs-roots-only-127` → `main`
- **Issue**: [#127](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/issues/127) — `ohtv list` and `refs` surface sub-conversations as siblings of their roots
- **Cluster slot**: fourth and final issue in the #122 root-grain cluster's display surface (after #123 / #124 / #125; #128 RAG dedup remains).
- **PR status when this entry was written**: ready-for-review, CI green (lint pass 5s, pytest pass 58s), `pr-review[bot]` re-triggered by the draft→ready flip.

**Squash subject**: `feat(list,refs): roots-only by default with subtree rollup (#127)` — `feat:` minor bump per the AGENTS.md commit contract; the squash body carries a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer noting the user-facing default flip. With `[tool.semantic_release] major_on_zero = false` this lands as **v0.18.0** with a `⚠ BREAKING CHANGES` CHANGELOG entry (NOT v1.0.0), matching the v0.17.0 precedent set by PR #154 for #125.

**Shape A from the expansion**:
1. `expand_to_roots(conn, conv_ids) -> set[str]` added to `src/ohtv/filters.py` (+63). Maps each id to its `root_conversation_id` (migration 020), normalizes dashed input, passes unknown ids through unchanged for FS-fallback symmetry.
2. The four `_filter_by_*` helpers in `cli.py` (at the exact cut-site line numbers called out in the issue body: L1899 / L2072 / L2106 / L2179) gain `include_subs: bool = False` and call `expand_to_roots` between the lookup and the `filter_conversations_by_ids` reduce when False.
3. `_resolve_refs_subtree` + `_extract_refs_subtree` added to `cli.py`. `ohtv refs <root-id>` rolls up refs across the delegation tree by reusing the per-conv `_extract_refs_from_conversation` extractor (no new SQL surface in the ref store, as the issue's A/B/C matrix recommended); `ohtv refs <sub-id>` is bit-for-bit unchanged.
4. `--include-sub-conversations` Click option added to both `ohtv list` and `ohtv refs`. Spelling matches #125's flag (NOT `--include-subs`).

**Migration-020 guardrails**: store-level `_assert_root_column_present_for_list` (landed in PR #154) covers the `list_by_date_range` SELECT path. This PR adds an inline `PRAGMA table_info(conversations)` check in `_resolve_refs_subtree` for the new `refs <root-id>` rollup path, raising `RuntimeError("refs requires migration 020; run 'ohtv db scan' to apply pending migrations")` when absent. Both guards fire at command invocation, not import.

**Test coverage** (+19, total 2082 passed, 2 skipped, 3 xfailed, 0 regressions):
- 8 `TestExpandToRoots` unit tests in `tests/unit/test_filters.py` — mapping semantics, dashed-id normalization, multi-tree mixing, multi-sub collapse, orphan-as-root, empty/unknown input.
- 11 CLI integration tests in new `tests/unit/test_cli_list_refs_subs.py` covering all five issue ACs (T-1 through T-5) plus subtree-shape and help-text smoke tests. Both the refs-side and list-side migration-020 guardrails are exercised on hand-rolled pre-020 schemas (SQLite < 3.35 lacks `DROP COLUMN`, so the test constructs a legacy `conversations` table directly rather than migrating-and-dropping).

**Sibling-contrast table** (now updated in the PR body):
| Issue | Command | Fix shape | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| #123 | `report weekly-counts` | predicate in WHERE | ✅ PR #150 → v0.16.1 |
| #124 | `report velocity` | DISTINCT keyed on root | ✅ PR #153 → v0.16.2 |
| #125 | `gen objs/titles/run` | flag-threaded predicate, default False | ✅ PR #154 → v0.17.0 ⚠ BREAKING |
| **#127** | **`list`, `refs`** | **flag-threaded predicate + filter-set expand + subtree rollup, default False** | **PR #155, in review** ⚠ BREAKING |

**No `AGENTS.md` edit in this PR** per the cluster convention from #123/#124/#125's worklog entries (AGENTS.md is owned by #122 / cluster umbrella; per-issue PRs do not append items).

**Follow-up considerations** (noted in the PR reflection section):
- The store-level guard message still says `"gen requires migration 020"` even when invoked from `ohtv list` / `ohtv refs`. Minor UX rough edge — the actionable advice (`ohtv db scan`) is identical. Could be addressed by threading a command-name kwarg through `list_by_date_range`; not done in this PR to keep the diff focused.
- `--tree` nested rendering (subs indented under their root) remains explicitly out of scope per the issue body — separate follow-on issue.

**Backlog state**: with #127 in review, the `ready` slot for impl workers is empty until #128 lands the RAG-dedup counterpart. Next orchestrator cycle can spawn a review/QA worker on PR #155 or pull the next priority issue.

EXIT per issue-implementation skill — docs, review handling, and QA are separate conversations.

### 2026-05-30 00:55 UTC - Expansion worker (#148 LiteLLM botocore noise)

✅ **Expanded Issue #148 — `ready` for impl**

- Issue: [#148](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/issues/148) — Suppress LiteLLM botocore warnings at import time
- Type: Enhancement (polish)
- Status: Ready for implementation

**Reproduction**: current pinned `litellm==1.80.10` does NOT fire the exact warnings — line numbers in the reporter's traceback (`common_utils.py:979`) don't exist in that file (963 lines total). Reporter's environment is on a newer LiteLLM where the Bedrock/SageMaker provider modules added an eager `try: from botocore.parsers import EventStreamJSONParser / except ImportError: verbose_logger.warning(...)` at import time. Confirmed via grep across `.venv/lib/python3.13/site-packages/litellm/`.

**Key finding**: the warnings are `logging.getLogger("LiteLLM")` records, NOT Python `warnings.warn` records. The orchestrator's `warnings.filterwarnings("ignore", module="botocore.*")` suggestion would silently no-op. Documented this in the technical comment so the impl worker doesn't burn time on the wrong shape.

**Chosen approach**: `os.environ.setdefault("LITELLM_LOG", "ERROR")` in `src/ohtv/__init__.py`. Wins the race against `openhands-sdk`'s post-import `disable_logger("LiteLLM", logging.ERROR)` call because LiteLLM reads `LITELLM_LOG` in `litellm/_logging.py` at module init (`log_level = os.getenv("LITELLM_LOG", "DEBUG")`). `setdefault` preserves user overrides (`LITELLM_LOG=DEBUG ohtv ask ...`) — no separate escape-hatch env var needed.

**Placement rationale** (confirmed via `python -X importtime -c "from ohtv import cli"`): `litellm` is pulled in transitively through `ohtv.db.stages → ohtv.analysis.embeddings → ohtv.analysis.embeddings.client`, which runs BEFORE any Click callback. Therefore `setup_logging` / `init_logging_from_cli` (PR #147, Issue #121) is too late — must be in `ohtv/__init__.py` so it runs on first `import ohtv.*`.

**Labels applied**: `ready`, `enhancement`. Issue body rewritten to Problem Statement / Proposed Solution / Acceptance Criteria / Out of Scope. Technical comment posted with full reproduction notes, chosen approach, placement rationale, files-to-modify table, three-test regression plan (must subprocess for clean module state), and risks/non-risks.

EXIT per expand-issue skill — implementation is a separate conversation.

### 2026-05-30 01:24 UTC - Merge worker (#151 centralize DB migration)

✅ **Merged PR #151** — `refactor(db): centralize migration through get_ready_connection`

- **PR**: [#151](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/pull/151) — squash-merged into `main` as [`b93c2477`](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/commit/b93c24773e7cfd1a80020d49192f3b4aa92f8f07)
- **Issue closed**: [#116](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/issues/116) — Centralize DB migration into a single 'ensure ready' entry point
- **Branch**: `feat/centralize-db-migration-116` → `main`
- **Merged at**: 2026-05-30T01:24:00Z

**Merge gates verified before squash**: CI green (lint, pytest, pr-review), approved by `github-actions[bot]`/pr-review, `MERGEABLE` / `CLEAN` per GraphQL, 0 review threads, manual test report at 00:56:46Z covering 15 scenarios all PASS (last commit at 00:36:47Z predates the test). Docs update not required — internal refactor only; zero user-facing CLI surface change.

**Conventional commit type `refactor:`** — intentional. Per AGENTS.md release contract, `refactor:` is in the "no version bump, hidden from CHANGELOG" tier. python-semantic-release will NOT cut a release for this commit, which is the correct outcome for a behavior-preserving internal restructuring. No `feat:` / `fix:` rewrite — the PR adds zero new user-observable capability and fixes no reported bug; the visible effect is "fewer `no such table` errors after a fresh checkout", which is a refactor outcome, not a fix of a tracked issue.

**Diff shape**: 9 files, +650 / -58. Production code: `db/connection.py` (+48 — the new helper), `db/__init__.py` (+2 / -1 — re-export), `analysis/cache.py` (+6 / -9), `cli.py` (+21 / -32), `conversations.py` (+8 / -16). Tests: 3 new files totalling +564 (helper contract, fresh-install CLI integration, allow-list regression). Docs: `AGENTS.md` +1 (item #25 bullet).

**PR slot now empty**. Expansion slot also empty (PR #148 expanded and `ready` per prior orchestrator entry). Backlog at 8 `ready` issues: #123, #124, #125, #127, #128, #145, #148, #149. `#145` still sequencing-blocked behind `#149` per prior note. Next orchestrator pass can freely spawn one impl worker on the highest-priority `ready` issue.

EXIT per merge-pr skill — orchestrator picks up the empty PR slot on next cron trigger.

### 2026-05-30 01:48 UTC - Orchestrator

**Active Workers:**
| Conv ID | Type | Working On | Status |
|---------|------|------------|--------|
| `e93754b` | implementation | Issue #123 - report weekly-counts over-counts subs | **NEW** |

**Spawned: Implementation Worker**
- Issue: [#123 - `report weekly-counts` over-counts when sub-conversations exist](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/issues/123) (priority:medium)
- Conversation: [`e93754b`](https://app.all-hands.dev/conversations/e93754b0bfc947c7945b9ec985893d70)
- Branch suggestion in spawn brief: `fix/weekly-counts-root-grain-123`
- Conventional commit type: `fix:` (patch bump per AGENTS.md release contract)

**Current State:**
- 0 unacknowledged `## INSTRUCTION:` entries.
- **PR slot:** was empty after PR #151 merged at 01:24Z. Now occupied by the new impl worker.
- **Expansion slot:** OPEN, IDLE. 0 issues need expansion (no label-less open issues; the 8 `ready` issues span the queue's bottom). **Becomes the 23rd consecutive idle expansion cycle if next cycle still finds nothing to expand.**
- **Ready issues backlog (8):** #123 (now impl), #124, #125, #127, #128 all `priority:medium` (sub-conversation roll-up siblings of #122 foundation); #145 (sequencing-blocked behind #149), #148 (litellm warning suppression), #149 (5-level context expansion).
- **Why #123:** lowest-numbered `priority:medium` ready issue. All five `priority:medium` issues are tied; per worklog convention (and the merge worker's hand-off note), tie-break is lowest issue number. #145/#148/#149 are unprioritized and would only be picked after the `priority:medium` tier drains.
- **Sequencing note:** #123–#128 are independent of each other once #122's foundation landed (PR #138, merged earlier today). Each can be implemented in any order; the impl worker has a self-contained brief that consumes `list_roots` + `conversations_by_root` without touching the other roll-up commands.

**Sync notes:**
- Container respawned this cycle. `uv venv` + `uv pip install git+...lxa.git git+...ohtv.git` to a local `.venv` (the `--system` path still hits read-only `/usr/local/lib/python3.13/site-packages` per prior cycle's note — recording again for next respawn). `ohtv sync --since 4h` succeeded silently with `OPENHANDS_API_KEY` in the env.
- `gh` authenticated via `GH_TOKEN=$github_token`.
- Spawn payload posted directly to `POST /api/v1/app-conversations` (X-Access-Token auth); start task `e53cf291` → `SETTING_UP_SKILLS` → `READY` in two polls (~8s); conversation `e93754b` is `execution_status=running`, `sandbox_status=RUNNING` at verification time.

**Auto-disable counter:** **0 → 0.** Productive cycle (impl worker spawned). **Thirty-third consecutive productive cycle.** Not at risk of auto-disable.

**Worklog size:** 2279 lines pre-entry. Truncation threshold (300) exceeded by ~7×. Deferred to the next quiet cycle to avoid mixing a truncation commit with the spawn-decision entry; the `truncate-worklog` skill should be run when the PR slot is genuinely idle.

**Next cycle expectations:**
- Impl worker `e93754b` likely still running (impl cycles on this codebase have been averaging ~30–60 min based on recent worklog entries for #143/#144/#147/#151).
- If finished: PR exists, draft → CI green path → **docs worker required** (`report weekly-counts` is a user-facing CLI command per AGENTS.md item #29; README's Reports section needs the root-grain caveat documented) → testing → review → merge.
- If still running: log `All quiet`-style status; do NOT spawn duplicate.
- Expansion slot stays idle until the human files new issues.

### 2026-05-30 01:55 UTC - Impl worker (#123 weekly-counts root grain)

🚧 **Opened PR #152** — `fix(reports): aggregate weekly-counts at root grain (#123)`

- **PR**: [#152](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/pull/152) — `fix/weekly-counts-root-grain-123` → `main`
- **Issue**: [#123](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/issues/123) — `report weekly-counts` over-counts when sub-conversations exist
- **CI status at hand-off**: lint=pass, pytest=pass (54s), pr-review skipped while draft → will run on ready transition
- **State**: marked **ready for review**

**Shape**: 3 files, +234 / -11. One-line SQL predicate `AND id = root_conversation_id` added to `_WEEKLY_COUNTS_SQL` in `src/ohtv/reports/weekly_counts.py`, plus a `_assert_root_column_present(conn)` guard at `fetch_rows` entry that raises `RuntimeError("report weekly-counts requires migration 020; run 'ohtv db scan' to apply pending migrations")` if migration 020 hasn't run. Tests: extended `_insert_conv` with `parent_conversation_id` / `root_conversation_id` kwargs (default `root_conversation_id = conv_id` preserves all existing tests), plus 5 new tests T-A through T-E covering same-week siblings, cross-week subs (with `--include-empty`), 2-deep chains, the missing-column error path, and single-root legacy regression. CLI snapshot helper `_seed_two_weeks` in `test_cli_weekly_counts.py` updated to set `root_conversation_id = id` (raw SQL inserts have to do what `ConversationStore.upsert` does in production).

**Implementation contract followed**: the issue's technical-approach comment explicitly chose the direct predicate `id = root_conversation_id` over going through the `conversations_by_root` view; rationale is that the view's value-add is roll-up of quantitative subtree fields (`SUM(event_count)`, `MIN/MAX` timestamps), and the report only reads `created_at` + `source`. The root's own `created_at` already equals `MIN(created_at)` across its subtree by construction. The view remains the right surface for #124 (velocity), which DOES need subtree sums. Per AGENTS.md item #32, this is the first consumer of the COALESCE-protected `root_conversation_id` column added by #122 / migration 020.

**Minor wording correction vs issue body**: the issue's expansion comment alternates between "migration 019" and "migration 020" in the error-message text. Migration 019 is `parent_conversation_id` (from #108); migration 020 is `root_conversation_id` (from #122). The PR uses "migration 020" since that's the migration that actually adds the column the guard tests for.

**Follow-up for future siblings (#124-#128)**: every existing test helper that bypasses `ConversationStore` and inserts directly via SQL into `conversations` may need the same `root_conversation_id = id` fix when its report adopts the root-grain filter. `_seed_two_weeks` and `_insert_conv` here are the templates. Worth surfacing on each sibling issue's PR.

EXIT — docs/testing/review handling is a separate conversation per orchestrate skill.

  - **Manual test results**: NONE → testing worker spawned this cycle
- **Issues**: 8 `ready`, 0 need expansion, 2 on `hold` (#26, #90)
  - Ready: #123 (now PR #152), #124, #125, #127, #128, #145, #148, #149

**Decision-tree trace:**

- **Step 1 — Human instructions**: 0 unacknowledged `## INSTRUCTION:` entries.
- **Step 2 — Active workers**: only `f473806` (this orchestrator) was `running` on conv-search. Impl `e93754b` for #123 = `finished` (handed off PR #152 at 01:59Z). PR slot CLEAR at cycle entry.
- **Expansion slot**: OPEN, but `gh issue list … contains(["ready"]) or contains(["hold"]) | not` → empty. Expansion slot stays IDLE — backlog is 8 deep on ready, nothing to expand.
- **PR slot**: OPEN. PR #152 ready, CI green, approved, 0 threads, NO manual test results.
  - **Decision**: row *"PR exists, ready, CI green, docs updated, no manual test results → Spawn testing worker"*.
  - **Docs check**: diff is 3 files — `src/ohtv/reports/weekly_counts.py` (+32/-0, SQL predicate + `_assert_root_column_present` guard) + 2 test files (+202/-11). **NO user-facing CLI surface change** — same command (`ohtv report weekly-counts`), same flags (`--since`/`--until`/`--source`/`--include-empty`/`--exclude-current-week`/`--out`), same CSV schema (`week,cloud,cli,total`). Per the orchestrate skill: *"Do NOT require docs update if only: Bug fixes that don't change documented behavior"* — this fix makes behavior MATCH the documented intent ("new-conversation counts bucketed by ISO 8601 week", per AGENTS.md #29). Docs update SKIPPED → straight to testing.

**Worker prompt scope**: 7 blackbox scenarios pre-specified (A: single conv unchanged, B: same-week root+sub = 1, C: cross-week with `--include-empty`, D: 2-deep chain = 1, E: real synced DB sanity check, F: pre-migration-020 RuntimeError path, G: CSV schema stability) + full unit test suite. Worker is GATED to post test report only — no review/merge per skill.

**Housekeeping**: WORKLOG.md was 2342 lines at cycle entry (>>300 threshold). Truncated via `/truncate-worklog` algorithm — kept 19 entries spanning 18:51Z (yesterday) → 01:55Z (today, ~7h productive span), archived 19 older entries to `WORKLOG_ARCHIVE_2026-05-29.md` (2769 lines). New worklog size: 1148 lines.

**Auto-disable check**: most recent orchestrator entries were all productive (spawns/merges/completions, NOT "All quiet"). No consecutive quiet trigger.

**Next**: cron picks up empty PR slot once testing worker posts results → merge worker dispatched. Expansion slot will keep idling until backlog drains below ~5 ready issues.

EXIT per orchestrate skill — one action per wake-up.

  - **Mergeable**: `MERGEABLE` / `CLEAN`
  - **Manual test results**: posted at 02:33:10Z by testing worker `06ac1e1` — **PASS** all 7 scenarios (A: subless baseline ✅, B: same-week root+2subs collapses to 1 ✅, C: cross-week sub + `--include-empty` ✅, D: 3-level chain ✅, E: real synced DB sanity ✅, F: pre-migration-020 RuntimeError ✅, G: CSV format stability ✅) + unit suite `2033 passed, 2 skipped, 3 xfailed`. Reviewer verdict: "Cleared to merge."
  - **No commits after the test report** → not outdated; merge gate cleared.
- **Issues**: 8 `ready` (#123 now PR #152, #124, #125, #127, #128, #145, #148, #149), 0 need expansion, 2 on `hold` (#26, #90).

**Decision-tree trace:**

- **Step 1 — Human INSTRUCTION check**: 0 unacknowledged (`awk '/^```/{f=!f;next} !f && /^## INSTRUCTION:/{print}' WORKLOG.md` → empty).
- **Step 2 — Active workers**: testing worker `06ac1e1` for PR #152 = `finished` at 02:33:18Z (~12 min runtime — typical for 7 blackbox scenarios + 2050-test unit suite + comment posting). All other recent worker conv IDs (`e93754b`, `25468bb`, `7c9951d`) = `PAUSED` with `execution_status=null` — finished and reaped. **PR slot CLEAR at entry.**
- **Expansion slot**: OPEN. `gh issue list … contains(["ready"]) or contains(["hold"]) | not` → empty. Slot stays **IDLE** — backlog is 8 deep on ready, nothing to expand. **24th consecutive idle expansion cycle** (matches recent pattern; not at risk of auto-disable because PR slot is productive).
- **PR slot**: OPEN. PR #152 ready, CI green, manual tests PASS, 0 review threads, APPROVED.
  - Decision-tree row matched: *"PR exists, ready, test results valid, good rating, docs valid → Spawn merge worker"*.
  - **Docs spot-check skipped**: zero commits between docs/testing landing and now (single-commit PR), and the diff has no user-facing CLI surface change (same command name, same flags, same CSV schema — verified in test G). The orchestrate skill: *"PR exists, ready, test results valid, good rating, docs outdated → docs spot-check"* — docs are NOT outdated because nothing relevant exists to update. Straight to merge.
- **Re-test skipped**: last commit (01:55Z) predates last test (02:33Z) by 38 min. No commits since the test. Trivially current.

**Merge worker brief** explicitly:
- Uses conventional commit type `fix:` (patch bump per AGENTS.md release contract; will trigger `ohtv-vX.Y.(Z+1)` from current `ohtv-v0.16.0`).
- References `Closes #123` in the squash body so GitHub auto-closes the issue on merge.
- Watches the auto-release workflow + verifies the `chore(release): ohtv X.Y.Z [skip ci]` commit and new tag land within ~30-60s.
- Updates WORKLOG.md with merge SHA + release tag.
- Hard rule: DO NOT push to `main` directly (squash-merge is `gh pr merge`'s job); only the WORKLOG.md entry goes directly to `main`.

**Worklog housekeeping**: WORKLOG.md was 1197 lines at cycle entry (above the 300-line threshold). NOT truncating this cycle — last truncation was 26 min ago (cycle at 02:20Z reduced 2342→1148; only +49 lines growth since). Will revisit on next idle cycle to avoid touching `main` twice in the same orchestrator cadence while a merge worker is actively writing to it.

**Auto-disable counter**: **0 → 0.** Productive cycle (merge worker spawned). **Thirty-fourth consecutive productive cycle.** No risk.

**Next cycle expectations** (~03:15-03:20Z window):
- Merge worker `37e670a` likely `finished` with PR #152 merged at `ohtv-v0.16.1` (or higher if the release workflow batched). PR slot empty. Expansion slot still idle.
- Decision tree → "No open PR + ready issues, no [high] priority → Run `/assess-priority` inline, then spawn impl worker." Candidates: #124, #125, #127, #128 (all `priority:medium` sub-conversation roll-up siblings of the just-merged #123). Tie-break: lowest issue number → #124 (`report velocity` double-counts human input when subs share a PR) is the natural next pick because it's the closest analogue to #123 (same `conversations_by_root` foundation, same per-week bucket grain, immediately leverages the testing-pattern just proven on #152).
- If merge worker is still running, log "All quiet — merge in progress."
- If something has gone wrong with the release workflow, diagnosis is in the merge worker's WORKLOG entry, not the next orchestrator pass.

EXIT per orchestrate skill — one action per wake-up.

### 2026-05-30 02:50 UTC - Merge worker (#152 weekly-counts root grain)

✅ **Merged PR #152** — `fix(reports): aggregate weekly-counts at root grain (#123)`

- **PR**: [#152](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/pull/152) — squash-merged into `main` as [`75eb2cb7`](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/commit/75eb2cb75031c2a165122ea4cd8a7b57e4c02f04)
- **Issue closed**: [#123](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/issues/123) — `report weekly-counts` over-counts when sub-conversations exist (auto-closed via `Closes #123` in squash body at 02:50:02Z)
- **Branch**: `fix/weekly-counts-root-grain-123` → `main`
- **Merged at**: 2026-05-30T02:50:01Z
- **Release tag**: [`ohtv-v0.16.1`](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/releases/tag/ohtv-v0.16.1) at commit [`cab9424`](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/commit/cab9424) (`chore(release): ohtv 0.16.1 [skip ci]`). Patch bump from `ohtv-v0.16.0` — exactly what `fix:` should yield per AGENTS.md release contract.

**Merge gates verified before squash**: CI green (lint, pytest, pr-review all SUCCESS), APPROVED by `github-actions[bot]`/pr-review, `MERGEABLE` / `CLEAN` per GraphQL, 0 review threads, manual test report at 02:33:10Z covering 7 scenarios A–G all PASS ("Cleared to merge"), single commit on branch at 01:55:41Z predating the test by 38 min, no rework after testing. Docs spot-check skipped — single-commit PR with no user-facing CLI surface change (same command, same flags, same `week,cloud,cli,total` CSV header; the only observable behavior delta is "cloud column now counts roots not roots+subs", which is the bug fix itself).

**Conventional commit type `fix:`** — intentional and aligned with the PR title / issue type. Per AGENTS.md release contract (`fix:` → patch bump, surfaces in CHANGELOG under "Bug Fixes"), python-semantic-release parsed the squash subject and cut `ohtv-v0.16.1` automatically. Release workflow ran cleanly: `gh run list --workflow release.yml` shows ✓ SUCCESS in 2m14s, no concurrency-group conflicts (the preceding `chore(worklog):` push from the orchestrator finished 1m12s earlier so the runs serialized cleanly). `[skip ci]` marker on the auto-release commit preserved — won't re-trigger the workflow.

**Diff shape**: 3 files, +234 / -11. Production code: `src/ohtv/reports/weekly_counts.py` (+32, no deletions — adds the `AND id = root_conversation_id` SQL predicate to `_WEEKLY_COUNTS_SQL` plus an `_assert_root_column_present(conn)` guard at `fetch_rows` entry that raises a clear `RuntimeError("report weekly-counts requires migration 020; run 'ohtv db scan' to apply pending migrations")` when migration 020 hasn't been applied). Tests: `tests/unit/reports/test_weekly_counts.py` (+187 / -4 — `_insert_conv` extended with `parent_conversation_id` / `root_conversation_id` kwargs defaulting to self-root so existing tests stay unchanged, plus 5 new tests T-A through T-E), `tests/unit/reports/test_cli_weekly_counts.py` (+15 / -7 — the CLI snapshot helper's raw-SQL inserts now set `root_conversation_id = id` matching what `ConversationStore.upsert` does in production). Full unit suite at merge: 2033 passed / 2 skipped / 3 xfailed.

**Design contract preserved**: per the issue's technical-approach comment, this PR used the direct SQL predicate (`id = root_conversation_id`) rather than the `conversations_by_root` view. The view's value-add is roll-up of quantitative subtree fields (`SUM(event_count)`, `MIN/MAX` timestamps); this report only needs `created_at` + `source`, and the root's own `created_at` already equals `MIN(created_at)` across its subtree by construction (a sub cannot exist before its parent). The view remains the correct surface for #124 (velocity), which DOES roll up subtree sums. AGENTS.md item #32 already documents this as the first consumer of the COALESCE-protected `root_conversation_id` column from #122 / migration 020 — no AGENTS.md edit needed.

**PR slot now empty**. Expansion slot also empty. Backlog at 7 `ready` issues post-#123 close: #124, #125, #127, #128 (all `priority:medium` sub-conversation roll-up siblings), #145 (sequencing-blocked behind #149), #148 (litellm warning suppression), #149 (5-level context expansion). Per the orchestrator's forecast in the immediately-prior entry, #124 (`report velocity` double-counts human input when subs share a PR) is the natural next pick — same `conversations_by_root` foundation, same per-week grain, immediately leverages the testing pattern just proven on #152.

EXIT per merge-pr skill — orchestrator picks up the empty PR slot on next cron trigger.

### 2026-05-30 03:22 UTC - Orchestrator

**Active Workers (at cycle exit):**
| Conv ID   | Type           | Working On                                                              | Status         |
|-----------|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|
| `2a022b3` | implementation | Issue #124 — `report velocity` double-counts via sub-conversations      | **NEW** running |

🚀 **Spawned: Implementation Worker for Issue #124**

- **Issue**: [#124](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/issues/124) — `report velocity` double-counts human input when sub-conversations share a PR (`priority:medium`, `ready`)
- **Conversation**: [`2a022b3`](https://app.all-hands.dev/conversations/2a022b37e3ae4d318c16fcfd0ed02c09) — `execution_status=running`, `sandbox_status=RUNNING`, `selected_repository=jpshackelford/ohtv`, `selected_branch=main` at 03:21:30Z (READY after 2 polls / ~12s; start task `0d5f2a43`).
- **Plugin**: `github:jpshackelford/.openhands/plugins/ohtv-workflow@feat/ohtv-workflow-plugin`
- **Suggested branch**: `fix/velocity-root-grain-124`
- **Conventional commit type**: `fix:` → patch bump to `ohtv-v0.16.2` per AGENTS.md release contract.

**Current State:**

- **PR slot**: was EMPTY (PR #152 merged 02:50:01Z, released as `ohtv-v0.16.1` at commit `cab9424`). Now occupied by this impl worker.
- **Expansion slot**: OPEN, IDLE. 0 issues need expansion (`gh issue list … contains(["ready"]) or contains(["hold"]) | not` → empty). **24th consecutive idle expansion cycle.** Not at risk of auto-disable (PR slot productive).
- **Ready issues backlog (7):** #124 (now impl), #125, #127, #128 (all `priority:medium` sub-conversation roll-up siblings of #122 foundation); #145 (sequencing-blocked behind #149), #148 (litellm warning suppression), #149 (5-level context expansion).
- **Hold**: #26, #90 (skipped — awaiting human).

**Decision-tree trace:**

- **Step 1 — Human INSTRUCTION check**: 0 unacknowledged (`awk '/^```/{f=!f;next} !f && /^## INSTRUCTION:/{print}' WORKLOG.md` → empty).
- **Step 2 — Active workers**: only `3fc03cb` (this orchestrator, `trigger=automation`) was `running` on conv-search. Merge worker `37e670a` (#152) = `PAUSED` per search (finished after posting merge entry at 02:50Z). Testing worker `06ac1e1` and impl worker `e93754b` similarly `PAUSED`. **PR slot CLEAR at cycle entry.**
- **Expansion slot**: OPEN. Empty backlog → stays IDLE.
- **PR slot**: OPEN. No open PRs (`gh pr list --repo jpshackelford/ohtv --state open` → `[]`). Ready backlog has prioritized issues → **Decision: spawn impl worker for highest-priority ready issue.**
  - **Why #124**: Among the four tied `priority:medium` issues (#124, #125, #127, #128), lowest-number wins per worklog convention. The merge-worker hand-off note in the immediately-prior entry also pre-forecast #124 specifically as "the natural next pick" — same `conversations_by_root` foundation as #123, immediately leverages the testing pattern just proven on PR #152.
  - **Strategy difference from #123 flagged in spawn brief**: #123 used a one-line `WHERE id = root_conversation_id` predicate. The issue body for #124 explains this won't work (the join key, not the WHERE clause, drives the dup) → JOIN-key change required. Spawn brief steers the worker to the technical-approach comment on #124 for the authoritative shape.
  - **Migration-number wording correction in spawn brief**: The issue body cites "migration 019" for `root_conversation_id`; the actual column is in migration 020 (#108 was 019 / parent). PR #152 corrected the same mismatch in its guard error message; the spawn brief explicitly tells the worker to cite migration 020, not 019.

**Sync notes:**

- Container respawned this cycle (`/workspace/project/ohtv` already checked out at main, clean tree). `pip install --user git+...lxa.git git+...ohtv.git` (the `uv pip install` path needed `--system` or a venv; switched to `pip --user` and exported `PATH=$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH` — recording for next respawn). `ohtv sync --since 4h` succeeded silently with `OH_API_KEY` in env.
- Spawn POST to `/api/v1/app-conversations` with `X-Access-Token: $OH_API_KEY` returned start task `0d5f2a43` in `WORKING` → polled `/start-tasks/search` twice → `STARTING_CONVERSATION` → `READY` → `app_conversation_id=2a022b37e3ae4d318c16fcfd0ed02c09`. Verified `execution_status=running`, `sandbox_status=RUNNING` on conv-search before exit.
- `lxa repo add jpshackelford/ohtv` created a new board ("Unnamed Board 1") for the fresh container — informational only, doesn't affect orchestrator decisions.

**Auto-disable counter:** **0 → 0.** Productive cycle (impl worker spawned). **Thirty-fifth consecutive productive cycle.** Not at risk.

**Worklog size:** 1278 lines pre-entry (above 300-line threshold but only +130 lines since last truncation at 02:20Z, +81 since the 02:49Z merge-worker entry). Deferring truncation to the next genuinely idle cycle to avoid touching `main` twice while an impl worker is potentially writing to WORKLOG with its hand-off entry.

**Next cycle expectations (~03:50-04:00Z window):**

- Impl worker `2a022b3` likely still `running` (impl cycles on this codebase have been averaging 30-60 min). If finished: a new PR exists (`fix/velocity-root-grain-124` → `main`), draft, CI status TBD.
- If PR ready + CI green + no docs concern (this is a bug fix with no user-facing CLI surface change, same as #123/PR #152) → spawn **testing worker** directly (skipping docs).
- If impl worker still running → log status, do NOT spawn duplicate.
- Expansion slot stays idle until human files new issues (or until backlog drops below ~5 ready).

EXIT per orchestrate skill — one action per wake-up.

### 2026-05-30 03:35 UTC - Implementation worker (#124 velocity root grain)

✅ **Opened PR #153 (ready for review)** — `fix(reports): aggregate velocity at root grain (#124)`

- **Issue**: [#124](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/issues/124) — `report velocity` double-counts human input when sub-conversations share a PR (`priority:medium`, `ready`)
- **PR**: [#153](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/pull/153) — branch `fix/velocity-root-grain-124` → `main`. Opened as DRAFT at 03:30Z, flipped to READY at 03:34Z after CI green.
- **Single commit**: [`66ea5cd`](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/pull/153/commits/66ea5cd) on top of `ec658d5` (main HEAD at branch creation).

**Diff shape**: 4 files, +410 / -10. Production code: `src/ohtv/reports/velocity.py` (+53 / -5 — rewrites the `_VELOCITY_SQL` DISTINCT sub-select to substitute `root_conversation_id` for `conversation_id` via an `INNER JOIN conversations c ON c.id = cc.conversation_id`, adds an extensive comment block explaining why a WHERE predicate cannot fix this (the duplication is in join cardinality, not in row set), adds the `_assert_root_column_present(conn)` guard at `fetch_raw_rows` entry mirroring #123/PR #152's pattern). Tests: `tests/unit/reports/conftest.py` (+26 / -4 — `seed_conversation` helper extended with `parent_conversation_id` / `root_conversation_id` kwargs defaulting to self-root, matching #123's `_insert_conv` shape), `tests/unit/reports/test_velocity.py` (+330 / 0 — 6 new regression tests T-A through T-F appended; existing 27 tests untouched). Plus `uv.lock` (+1 / -1, cosmetic: lockfile's ohtv line catches up from 0.15.0 → 0.16.1 to match the post-release `pyproject.toml` — release workflow doesn't regen the lockfile).

**Design contract followed**: per the issue's technical-approach comment, this PR took **Design B** (substitute the join key inside the DISTINCT sub-select), NOT Design A (build a new `human_input_by_root` view + duplicate the human/automation/unknown CASE policy inside it). Design B is a single self-contained SQL change with zero new schema, zero new view surface, and zero new store method. It acts on **both** the DISTINCT boundary (collapses root+sub to one row per change_ref) **and** the human-input join (because `dcc.conversation_id` is now the root's id, the outer `LEFT JOIN` only ever sees the root's `conversation_human_input` row — sub rows are never touched). Orphan contributions (a `conversation_contributions` row whose `conversation_id` is not in `conversations`) are dropped by the new `INNER JOIN`, matching the pre-#124 behaviour of the outer `LEFT JOIN` returning NULL → 0 words for them. No regression risk.

**Why #123's one-line predicate wouldn't work here**: #123 (`weekly-counts`) reads `conversations` directly and counts rows; filtering out non-root rows with `AND id = root_conversation_id` was sufficient. `report velocity` walks `change_refs → conversation_contributions → conversation_human_input` and never reads `conversations` directly. The duplication is in "how many (root + sub) rows reach the human-input join per change_ref", not in "which conversations exist". A WHERE predicate cannot reach into that join — the fix has to substitute the join key.

**Migration number wording**: per the orchestrator's spawn brief, used **migration 020** in the guard error message (not "019" as the issue body's AC mistakenly said). Migration 019 = parent_conversation_id (#108); migration 020 = root_conversation_id (#122). Same precedent as PR #152's guard.

**Conventional commit type `fix:`** — intentional. Per AGENTS.md release contract this will trigger a patch bump from `ohtv-v0.16.1` → `ohtv-v0.16.2` on squash-merge and surface under "Bug Fixes" in CHANGELOG. References `Closes #124` in the squash body for auto-close.

**Test coverage** (per AC table in PR description):

| Test | Asserts |
|------|---------|
| `test_root_plus_sub_same_pr_excludes_sub_words` | Words = 50 (root only, not 250); Msgs = 1 (root only, not 5); LOC unchanged at +100/-20/Total 120 |
| `test_root_plus_sub_cross_week_bucketed_by_merge` | Single bucket at 2024-W11 (merge week); Words = 50 (root only, not 850); Msgs = 3 (root only, not 13) |
| `test_root_plus_sub_loc_accounting_unchanged` | 2 merged PRs (one LOC populated, one NULL) → partial_loc=True, missing_loc_count=1, lines_added=150, total_loc=180; Words = 20 (root × 2 PRs, sub excluded) |
| `test_two_deep_chain_excludes_both_subs` | 2-deep chain (root → sub1 → sub2) → Words = 30 (root only, not 830), Msgs = 2 |
| `test_sub_only_contribution_attributes_to_root` | Sub-only contribution maps to root's chi row → Words = 42 (root, even though only sub had the contribution row) |
| `test_missing_root_column_raises_clear_error` | RuntimeError with `match="migration 020"` from `fetch_raw_rows` on a bare schema |

**Suite results**:
- `tests/unit/reports/test_velocity.py` alone: 33 passed (27 existing + 6 new) in 2.04s.
- `tests/unit/reports/` (all reports): 81 passed in 8.26s.
- Full unit suite: **2039 passed, 2 skipped, 3 xfailed** in 27.35s — +6 vs the 2033-pass baseline #152 left on `main`.
- Lint: `uv run ruff check src/ohtv/reports/velocity.py tests/unit/reports/test_velocity.py tests/unit/reports/conftest.py` → "All checks passed!"

**CI status (PR #153, before flip from draft to ready)**:

| Check | Result | Duration |
|-------|--------|----------|
| `lint` | ✓ pass | 4s |
| `pytest` | ✓ pass | 53s |
| `pr-review` | skipping (draft) | — |

Flipped to ready at 03:34Z via `gh pr ready 153`. `pr-review` will run on the ready event.

**Acceptance criteria check (all 7 ticked):**

1. ✓ Words / Words/LOC for change_ref touched by root + sub = root only (`test_root_plus_sub_same_pr_excludes_sub_words`)
2. ✓ Msgs deduped by root (same test)
3. ✓ LOC accounting (+Lines, -Lines, Total, partial_loc) unchanged (`test_root_plus_sub_loc_accounting_unchanged`)
4. ✓ Cross-week case: root in N, sub in N+1, merged in N+1 → bucket at N+1 with root's words once (`test_root_plus_sub_cross_week_bucketed_by_merge`)
5. ✓ Existing 27 velocity tests pass unchanged (verified by re-running pre-edit baseline then post-edit)
6. ✓ New regression tests added for root+sub case (6 new tests covering all 5 scenarios from the test plan, plus an extra T-E variant for sub-only-contribution which the test plan didn't explicitly require but is a natural addition that exercises the substituted join key from a different angle)
7. ✓ Guard raises `RuntimeError("report velocity requires migration 020; run 'ohtv db scan' to apply pending migrations")` when column missing (`test_missing_root_column_raises_clear_error`)

**Files explicitly NOT touched** (per technical-approach scope):
- `AGENTS.md` — the durable concept note about `root_conversation_id` as the cluster's de-dup boundary is owned by #122. #124 is the second consumer; we do not re-introduce the concept.
- `src/ohtv/db/stores/conversation_store.py` — Design B does not need a `human_input_by_root` API.
- `docs/reference/database.md` — schema docs belong to #122's PR.
- `src/ohtv/cli.py` `report velocity` command — no flag changes (per "Out of Scope: --include-subs").
- `src/ohtv/reports/charts.py` / `scripts/chart_velocity.py` — chart code consumes `VelocityRow` unchanged. No visual regression.

**Hand-off for next orchestrator pass** (~03:50-04:00Z window):

- **PR slot**: now occupied by READY PR #153. If `pr-review` bot APPROVES + CI stays green + no review threads → next action per the orchestrate skill's decision tree is **spawn testing worker** (skipping docs — same as #152's bug fix: no user-facing CLI surface change, no flags, no CSV header change; the only observable delta is "Words / Msgs / Words/LOC columns no longer over-count when subs contributed to the same PR").
- If `pr-review` requests changes → spawn iteration worker per usual.
- If CI flakes → re-run / iterate as appropriate.
- **Expansion slot**: still IDLE. Backlog at 6 ready issues post-this-spawn: #125 / #127 / #128 (medium, sub-conversation roll-up siblings), #145 (sequencing-blocked), #148 (litellm warning), #149 (5-level context expansion). Tie-break still lowest-number → next impl pick after #124 lands would be **#125** (gen objs/titles/run aggregation grain), which is the natural next sub-conversation roll-up sibling to clear.
- **Expected release on merge**: `ohtv-v0.16.2` patch bump per the `fix:` commit prefix. Release workflow will tag + push within ~30-60s post-merge, no PyPI publish (intentional per AGENTS.md).

EXIT per orchestrate skill — implementation done, PR ready for review, orchestrator picks up testing decision on next cron trigger.

  - **CI**: lint=SUCCESS, pytest=SUCCESS, pr-review=SUCCESS — all checks green at single commit [`66ea5cd`](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/pull/153/commits/66ea5cd) (03:26:57Z)
  - **Review**: APPROVED by `github-actions` `pr-review` bot at 03:31:16Z. Verdict: 🟢 LOW risk, "Good taste — elegant fix that eliminates the double-counting bug by changing the join grain from conversation to root. Worth merging — minimal, well-documented, thoroughly tested." Key insight noted: "fixes by changing the data structure (join key) rather than adding conditionals — the double-counting simply cannot occur when the DISTINCT is keyed on root grain."
  - **Mergeable**: `MERGEABLE` / `CLEAN`
  - **Manual test results**: **NONE** ← this cycle's gap
  - **No commits since review submission at 03:31:16Z** → not outdated; once tests land, merge gate is one orchestrator hop away.
- **Issues**: 7 `ready` (#124 now PR #153, #125, #127, #128 all `priority:medium`; #145, #148, #149 no priority), 0 need expansion, 2 on `hold` (#26, #90).

**Decision-tree trace:**

- **Step 1 — Human INSTRUCTION check**: 0 unacknowledged (`grep -E "^## INSTRUCTION:" WORKLOG.md` → empty).
- **Step 2 — Active workers**: prior impl worker `2a022b3` for PR #153 = `execution_status=finished`, `sandbox_status=RUNNING` (sandbox not yet reaped but conv done — entered terminal state after posting its hand-off entry at 03:35Z). All other recent worker conv IDs (`37e670a`, `06ac1e1`, `e93754b`, `1c2eba0`, `cc8ff6a`, `25468bb`, `7c9951d`, `652ba7e`, `0f04330`) = `PAUSED` with `execution_status=null`. **PR slot CLEAR at cycle entry.**
- **Expansion slot**: OPEN. `gh issue list … contains(["ready"]) or contains(["hold"]) | not` → empty. Slot stays **IDLE** — backlog is 7 deep on ready, nothing to expand. **25th consecutive idle expansion cycle.** Not at risk of auto-disable because PR slot remains productive.
- **PR slot**: OPEN at entry. PR #153 ready, CI green, APPROVED, 0 review threads, but **no manual test results posted yet**.
  - Decision-tree row matched: *"PR exists, ready, CI green, docs updated, no manual test results → Spawn testing worker"*.
  - **Docs update skipped per skill rule**: this PR introduces zero user-facing changes (same `report velocity` command, same flags, same `--chart` / `--csv` outputs, same `VelocityRow` dataclass shape). The skill's "Do NOT require docs update if only: ... bug fixes that don't change documented behavior" clause applies. Diff is `src/ohtv/reports/velocity.py` + `tests/unit/reports/test_velocity.py` + `tests/unit/reports/conftest.py` + `uv.lock` (cosmetic). README is unaffected. Same precedent as #152 (which also skipped docs).
- **Re-test consideration**: N/A — no prior test exists.

**Testing worker brief** explicitly covers:
- 8 blackbox scenarios A–H mirroring the AC table on PR #153 and #152's proven testing pattern:
  - A: subless baseline (no-op proof)
  - B: root+sub same PR same week (the bug)
  - C: cross-week sub-only contribution (bucket-by-merge week)
  - D: 2-deep chain root→sub1→sub2
  - E: LOC accounting unchanged (Lines+, Lines-, Total LOC, partial_loc, missing_loc_count)
  - F: migration-020 guard fires with correct message
  - G: chart output stability (`--chart /tmp/v.png` renders)
  - H (optional): CLI flags / CSV header unchanged
- Full unit-suite re-run with expected `2039 passed, 2 skipped, 3 xfailed` baseline (2033 from #152 + 6 new from PR #153).
- Migration-number wording reminder: the guard MUST reference migration **020**, not 019 — same gotcha PR #152 hit, called out explicitly in the brief so the tester knows what to verify in scenario F.

**Sync notes:**

- Container respawned (`/workspace/project/ohtv` already checked out at main, clean tree apart from a stray `uv.lock` mod that `git stash` cleared before pull). Pre-existing virtualenv at `.venv` already had ohtv installed.
- `uv pip install` needed `--system`/venv flag → switched to `uv sync` followed by `source .venv/bin/activate`, then installed `lxa` via `uv pip install git+...` inside the activated venv. Recording for next respawn: `uv sync && source .venv/bin/activate && uv pip install git+https://github.com/jpshackelford/lxa.git` is the clean sequence.
- `gh` CLI required `GH_TOKEN` env. The injected secret is `$github_token` (lowercase); `$GITHUB_TOKEN` (uppercase) is empty in this environment. Inline `GH_TOKEN="$github_token" gh ...` works; `export GH_TOKEN="$github_token"` once per session also works after the first command makes the env stick.
- `ohtv sync --since 4h --quiet` started but didn't return promptly — likely a multi-second silent sync. Not blocking on it since GH state is the orchestrator's source of truth, not local ohtv data this cycle.
- Spawn POST to `/api/v1/app-conversations` with `X-Access-Token: $OH_API_KEY` returned start task `d0d45e75` in `WORKING` → polled `/start-tasks/search` once → `READY` (very fast this run) → `app_conversation_id=366ad04805014a6abc8c2bb69cc63f50`. Verified `execution_status=running`, `sandbox_status=RUNNING` on conv-search before exit.

**Auto-disable counter:** **0 → 0.** Productive cycle (testing worker spawned). **Thirty-sixth consecutive productive cycle.** Not at risk.

**Worklog size:** 1407 lines pre-entry — above the 300-line truncation threshold. **Deferring truncation again** to a future genuinely idle cycle to avoid touching `main` twice while a worker is potentially writing its hand-off entry (testing-worker reports go to PR #153 as a comment, not WORKLOG, so the contention argument is weaker this cycle — but the next genuinely idle cycle remains the cleaner moment). If the next 2 cycles are also productive, force a truncation at that point regardless.

**Next cycle expectations (~04:20-04:30Z window):**

- Testing worker `366ad04` likely `finished` with manual-test report posted on PR #153 covering all 8 scenarios. Sub-conversation testing for scenarios B/C/D may take longer than #152's analogous run since fabricating a realistic root+sub+merged-PR fixture is meatier than the equivalent weekly-counts setup; ~25-40 min runtime plausible.
- If test report PASS + 0 commits since (very likely — APPROVED PR with no review threads, no expected rework) → next orchestrator decision-tree match: *"PR exists, ready, test results valid, good rating, docs valid → Spawn merge worker"*. Expected release: `ohtv-v0.16.2` patch bump per the `fix:` commit prefix.
- If test report FAIL on any scenario → spawn iteration worker for whichever bug it surfaces.
- Expansion slot stays idle through this cycle and the next (backlog at 6 medium-priority ready issues + 3 unprioritized; nothing to expand).
- If testing worker still running on next pass → log "All quiet — testing in progress." But unlikely given typical runtimes.

EXIT per orchestrate skill — one action per wake-up.

🚀 **Spawned: Merge Worker for PR #153**

- **PR**: [#153](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/pull/153) — `fix(reports): aggregate velocity at root grain (#124)`
- **Issue**: [#124](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/issues/124)
- **Branch**: `fix/velocity-root-grain-124`
- **Conversation**: [`e6546ca`](https://app.all-hands.dev/conversations/e6546ca198a648d1961f82b4b3d9b9e9) — `execution_status=running`, `sandbox_status=RUNNING`, `selected_repository=jpshackelford/ohtv` at 04:20Z (READY after 1 poll / ~5s; start task `e724357a`).
- **Expected**: `fix:`-prefixed squash-merge → semantic-release patch bump → `ohtv-v0.16.2` tag + GitHub Release within ~30-60s of merge.

**Current State:**

- [PR #153](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/pull/153): `oA green ready tested` — **all merge gates met**
  - **CI**: lint=SUCCESS, pytest=SUCCESS, pr-review=SUCCESS at HEAD `66ea5cd` (03:26:57Z)
  - **Review**: APPROVED by `github-actions` `pr-review` bot at 03:31:16Z (🟢 LOW risk)
  - **Manual Tests**: posted by `366ad04` at 04:05:20Z — **8/8 scenarios PASS** (subless baseline, root+sub same week, cross-week sub-only, 2-deep chain, LOC accounting unchanged, migration-020 guard, chart stability, CLI surface unchanged)
  - **Review threads**: 0 unresolved
  - **Mergeable**: `MERGEABLE` / `CLEAN`
  - **No commits since testing** (last commit 03:26:57Z, test results 04:05:20Z — testing was against final HEAD)
- **Issues**: 7 `ready` (#124 = PR #153 about to merge; #125, #127, #128 all `priority:medium`; #145, #148, #149 no priority), 0 need expansion, 2 on `hold` (#26, #90).

**Decision-tree trace:**

- **Step 1 — Human INSTRUCTION check**: 0 unacknowledged.
- **Step 2 — Active workers**: prior testing worker `366ad04` = `execution_status=finished` (sandbox still `RUNNING` but conv done — posted its hand-off test report at 04:05:20Z and exited). All prior workers (`2a022b3`, `37e670a`, `06ac1e1`, `e93754b`, `1c2eba0`, `cc8ff6a`, `25468bb`, `7c9951d`, `652ba7e`, `0f04330`) = PAUSED or finished. **PR slot CLEAR at cycle entry.**
- **Expansion slot**: OPEN. `gh issue list … contains(["ready"]) or contains(["hold"]) | not` → empty (7-deep ready backlog covers everything). Slot stays **IDLE**. **26th consecutive idle expansion cycle.** Not at risk of auto-disable because PR slot remains productive.
- **PR slot**: OPEN at entry. PR #153 ready, CI green, APPROVED, 0 review threads, **manual test results posted (8/8 PASS), no commits since**.
  - Decision-tree row matched: *"PR exists, ready, test results valid, good rating, docs valid → Spawn merge worker"*.
  - **Docs spot-check skipped per skill rule**: this PR introduces zero user-facing changes (same `report velocity` command, same flags, same `--chart` / `--csv` outputs, same `VelocityRow` dataclass shape). Skill's "Do NOT require docs update if only: bug fixes that don't change documented behavior" applies. No review-driven changes occurred (single commit `66ea5cd`, no rework). Same precedent as #152.

**Merge worker brief** covers:
- Conventional commit prefix `fix:` → patch bump → `ohtv-v0.16.2` (per AGENTS.md release contract).
- Squash commit summary line matching PR title.
- Body to call out: bug = double-count from outer LEFT JOIN to `conversation_human_input` when subs share a PR; fix = INNER JOIN to `conversations` + DISTINCT keyed on `root_conversation_id`; coverage = 6 new regression tests + 27 existing pass; migration-020 guard wording verified.
- Include `Fixes #124` / `Closes #124` footers (auto-close).
- Post-merge: verify `state=MERGED`, pull main, confirm release.yml workflow started, append completion entry to WORKLOG.md on main.

**Sync notes:**

- First spawn attempt used wrong payload shape (`initial_user_msg` + `repository`; should be `initial_message: {content: [{type, text}]}` + `selected_repository`). Two stray idle conversations (`75ea76ee`, `d3fcf921`) created with no repo/title applied and no `initial_message`. Attempted to pause via `/sandboxes/{id}/pause` but got `Method Not Allowed` — abandoning, they'll be reaped. **Recording correct payload shape for next respawn:** field names are `initial_message` (object with `content` array of `{type, text}` items), `selected_repository`, `selected_branch`, `title`, `git_provider`.
- After fixing payload, single-poll READY (~5s) → conv `e6546ca198a648d1961f82b4b3d9b9e9`, `execution_status=running`, `sandbox_status=RUNNING`, repo correctly attached.
- `gh` CLI required `GH_TOKEN="$github_token"` (lowercase secret name). Pattern: `export GH_TOKEN="$github_token"` once per shell.
- `ohtv sync` not run this cycle — GH state is the orchestrator's source of truth; saved a couple of minutes.

**Auto-disable counter:** **0 → 0.** Productive cycle (merge worker spawned, terminal action on PR #153). **Thirty-seventh consecutive productive cycle.** Not at risk.

**Worklog size:** 1480 lines pre-entry — still well above 300-line threshold. **Deferring truncation again** to a future genuinely idle cycle. Once PR #153 merges and the merge worker appends its completion entry (likely 04:30-04:40Z window), if the next cycle has nothing to do (PR slot empty + no expansion work + no impl pick ready — the 6 remaining ready issues are all sub-conversation-roll-up siblings or smaller chores, and impl will pick #125 next), that's the moment to truncate. Setting a soft target: truncate on the first post-#153-merge idle cycle, regardless of which slot is empty.

**Next cycle expectations (~04:45-04:55Z window):**

- Merge worker `e6546ca` likely `finished` with PR #153 merged via squash. Expected merge SHA on main. CHANGELOG.md updated by `chore(release): ohtv 0.16.2 [skip ci]` commit. Tag `ohtv-v0.16.2` pushed. GitHub Release `ohtv-v0.16.2` published.
- PR slot becomes OPEN. No open PRs. Decision-tree row: *"No open PR + ready issues with priority"* → 4 candidates (#124 will be closed by then; remaining priority:medium are #125, #127, #128). All 3 are sub-conversation roll-up siblings to the just-merged #124. Tie-break = lowest number → **#125** (`gen objs/titles/run` multi-conv mode treats sub-conversations as independent units of human intent).
- Expansion slot stays idle (no issues need expansion).
- Predicted action: **spawn implementation worker for #125**.
- If merge worker hits a snag (e.g., release.yml race, mergeability flip) → spawn merge-retry or iteration worker as appropriate.

EXIT per orchestrate skill — one action per wake-up.

## 2026-05-30T04:21Z — Merge worker: PR #153 shipped as ohtv-v0.16.2

**Trigger:** Orchestrator handoff at 04:20Z — PR #153 (`fix(reports): aggregate velocity at root grain (#124)`) verified merge-ready:
- CI green at HEAD `66ea5cd` (lint=SUCCESS, pytest=SUCCESS, pr-review=SUCCESS).
- pr-review bot APPROVED at 03:31Z with verdict 🟢 LOW risk ("Good taste — elegant fix that eliminates the double-counting bug by changing the join grain from conversation to root").
- Manual QA posted at 04:05Z by testing worker `366ad04`: 8/8 scenarios PASS (subless baseline, root+sub same week, cross-week sub-only, 2-deep chain, LOC accounting unchanged, migration-020 guard, chart stability, CLI surface unchanged).
- 0 unresolved review threads, `mergeable=MERGEABLE` / `mergeStateStatus=CLEAN`.

**Actions:**
1. Cloned repo, checked out `fix/velocity-root-grain-124` at `66ea5cd`. Re-read full PR diff + description — description accurately reflects final state (problem statement, fix rationale, SQL snippet, file list, test-coverage table, AC checklist all current). No edits needed.
2. Crafted squash commit:
   - **Subject**: `fix(reports): aggregate velocity at root grain (#124)` (matches PR title; `fix:` prefix drives patch bump).
   - **Body**: Problem (root+sub double-count after #108 + #122; `followup_word_count` / `followup_message_count` slipped through the `'automation'` mask, LOC unaffected) → Fix rationale (WHERE predicate insufficient because duplication is in join cardinality, not row set; INNER JOIN `conversations` projects `root_conversation_id` as join key; orphan-contribution behaviour preserved) → migration-020 guard (mirrors #123) → test coverage (6 new regressions, 27 existing pass, 81-test reports suite green, 8/8 manual QA) → `Fixes #124` / `Closes #124`.
3. Squash-merged via `gh pr merge 153 --squash`.
4. Verified: `state=MERGED`, `mergedAt=2026-05-30T04:20:57Z`, merge SHA **`c79ffde8674d3dd309357a05c1e2953125068ebc`**.
5. Pulled `main` — `c79ffde` is HEAD.
6. Release workflow started: run ID `26674334321` (status `*` in progress at log time). Expected to bump `pyproject.toml` / `src/ohtv/__init__.py` to `0.16.2`, append CHANGELOG entry under "Bug Fixes", tag `ohtv-v0.16.2`, and push within ~30-60s. Did not wait for completion per task brief.

**AC verification summary** (carried from PR description, all checkboxes ticked pre-merge):
- ✅ `Words` and `Words/LOC` for a `change_ref` touched by root + sub = root only (T-B).
- ✅ `Msgs` de-duped by root (T-B).
- ✅ LOC accounting (`+Lines`, `-Lines`, `Total`, `partial_loc`) unchanged (T-D).
- ✅ Cross-week case: root in N, sub in N+1, merged in N+1 → words count toward N+1 once (T-C).
- ✅ Existing 27 velocity tests + 81-test reports suite pass unchanged.

**Follow-up notes for orchestrator:**
- After release workflow completes (~04:22Z), `ohtv-v0.16.2` tag and CHANGELOG entry should be visible. The auto-generated `chore(release): ohtv 0.16.2 [skip ci]` commit will be HEAD of main, NOT this merge commit.
- This closes the #124 → #153 chain. Next velocity-related work item, if any, would track display-grain follow-ups, but no carry-over for the orchestrator from this PR.
- Per AGENTS.md item #32 (root-grain aggregation), this PR is the second of the per-command rollouts (`#123` shipped `weekly_counts` at `ohtv-v0.16.1`; this ships `velocity`). Remaining root-grain consumers per #32: `gen objs/titles/run` (#125), `classify` (#126), `list`/`refs` (#127), RAG `ask`/`search` (#128). Those are independent PRs.
- Worklog size now well above the 300-line truncation threshold; orchestrator should still defer truncation to a genuinely idle cycle (no contention argument changes here).

**Active Workers (at cycle exit):**
| Conv ID   | Type           | Working On                                                                | Status          |

| `5c05fff` | implementation | Issue #125 — `gen objs/titles/run` sub-conversation grain                 | **NEW** running |

🛠️ **Spawned: Implementation Worker for Issue #125**

- **Issue**: [#125](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/issues/125) — `gen objs/titles/run` multi-conv mode treats sub-conversations as independent units of human intent
- **Priority**: `priority:medium`
- **Cluster slot**: 3rd of the #122 root-grain rollout series (sibling-after-merge of #123→v0.16.1 and #124→v0.16.2)
- **Conversation**: [`5c05fff`](https://app.all-hands.dev/conversations/5c05fff...) — `execution_status=running`, `sandbox_status=RUNNING`, `selected_repository=jpshackelford/ohtv` at 04:49:30Z (READY after 1 poll / ~5s; start task `d419a19f`).
- **Expected branch**: `feat/gen-roots-only-125`
- **Expected commit prefix**: `feat:` → minor bump → **`ohtv-v0.17.0`** on merge.

**Current State (at cycle entry):**

- **Open PRs**: 0 ✅ (PR #153 merged at 04:20:57Z as merge SHA `c79ffde`; release tag `ohtv-v0.16.2` cut at `541b8d6` — current HEAD of main).
- **Issues needing expansion**: 0 (none — all open issues are either `ready` or `hold`).
- **Ready issues (6)**:
  - `priority:medium`: **#125** (now being implemented), #127 (`list`/`refs` sub roll-up display), #128 (RAG citation dedup)
  - No priority: #145 (gen-objs full-context key variants), #148 (litellm botocore warnings), #149 (5-level context expansion)
- **On hold (2)**: #26, #90
- **Recent main history**:
  - `541b8d6` chore(release): ohtv 0.16.2 [skip ci]
  - `1f7b946` chore(worklog): merge worker shipped #153 as ohtv-v0.16.2
  - `c79ffde` fix(reports): aggregate velocity at root grain (#124)

**Decision-tree trace:**

- **Step 1 — Human INSTRUCTION check**: 0 unacknowledged (`awk '/^\`\`\`/{f=!f;next} !f && /^## INSTRUCTION:/{print}' WORKLOG.md` → empty).
- **Step 2 — Active workers**: Only `3b8fcfc` (this orchestrator conv) was `running` at entry. Prior merge worker `e6546ca` for PR #153 = `PAUSED` / `execution_status=null` (terminal — completed its hand-off entry at 04:21:55Z `1f7b946`). All other recent worker conv IDs (`d3fcf92`, `75ea76e`, `afee19f`, `366ad04`, `cae3819`, `2a022b3`, `3fc03cb`, `37e670a`, `06fa0b1`, `06ac1e1`, `f47380`, `e93754b`, `677db4f`, `1c2eba0`, `cc8ff6a`, `80a8953`, `25468bb`, `7c9951d`) = `PAUSED` or `MISSING`. **PR slot CLEAR; expansion slot CLEAR at cycle entry.**
- **Expansion slot**: OPEN. `gh issue list … (ready or hold) | not` → empty. Slot stays **IDLE**. **27th consecutive idle expansion cycle.** Not at auto-disable risk because PR slot productive this cycle.
- **PR slot**: OPEN at entry, no open PR. Decision-tree row matched: *"No open PR + ready issues with priority → Spawn impl worker for highest priority ready issue (tie-break = lowest number)"*.
  - Tie-break among `priority:medium` ready issues: **#125 < #127 < #128** → impl pick is **#125**.
  - This matches the previous orchestrator entry's predicted action exactly: *"Predicted action: spawn implementation worker for #125."*

**Implementation worker brief** (full text in spawn payload) anchors on:

- **Fix shape = Option B** per the expansion: thread `include_subs: bool = False` flag through the existing pipeline (`ConversationStore.list_by_date_range` → `get_conversations` → `_load_all_conversations` → `_apply_conversation_filters`). NOT a new mirror method.
- **CLI surface**: `--include-sub-conversations` flag added to `gen objs`, `gen titles`, `gen run` with identical help text `"Include sub-conversations created by agent delegation (default: roots only)"` per the expansion's verbatim sentence.
- **Migration-020 guard** mirroring #123 (`weekly-counts`) and #124 (`velocity`) — `RuntimeError("<command> requires migration 020; run 'ohtv db scan' to apply pending migrations")`. **Reminder embedded in brief**: migration number is **020 not 019** (the #152 gotcha that #153 called out).
- **Single-conv mode unchanged** (`gen objs <id>` bypass at `cli.py:8281–8292` not touched).
- **No cache-key change** — per the expansion's gating-question #5, cache stays per-conversation-id only.
- **Filesystem-fallback symmetry** is a literal AC bullet to preserve.
- **Test surface**: regression tests in `tests/unit/test_cli_gen.py` + mirror tests in `_gen_titles.py` and `_gen_run.py` + DB-layer tests on `list_by_date_range`'s new flag.
- **Out-of-scope** (literally enumerated in brief): hierarchical analysis, #126 (classify policy), #127 (list/refs display), #128 (RAG dedup), flag renaming to `--include-subs`, new migration.

**Sibling-contrast carry-over** (orchestrator's tracker, mirrors expansion's table):

| # | Surface | Fix style | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| #123 | `report weekly-counts` | 1-line predicate in `WHERE` | shipped `v0.16.1` |
| #124 | `report velocity` | DISTINCT-keyed-on-root substitute | shipped `v0.16.2` |
| **#125** | `gen objs/titles/run` | **Flag on filter pipeline → predicate in `list_by_date_range`** | **PR pending** |
| #126 | `classify` policy | (subs → `automation` short-circuit) | not started |
| #127 | `list`/`refs` display | (roll-up UX) | not started |
| #128 | RAG `ask`/`search` dedup | (`EmbeddingStore.search_conversations` path) | not started |

**Sync notes:**

- `ohtv` and `lxa` re-installed via `uv tool install git+...` — the `--system` flag failed (sandbox `/usr/local/lib/python3.13` is read-only). Path `/home/openhands/.local/bin` added to PATH for this session. `lxa repo add jpshackelford/ohtv` created a new board (no prior board persisted across container respawn) — board name `Unnamed Board 1`, fine for read-only use this cycle.
- `ohtv sync` hung silently — abandoned (GH state is the orchestrator's truth, board is read-only this cycle).
- `gh` CLI needed `GH_TOKEN="$github_token"` (lowercase env var name); `$GITHUB_TOKEN` is empty. Pattern: `export GH_TOKEN="$github_token"` once per shell.
- **Spawn payload shape (confirmed working)**: `{title, selected_repository, selected_branch, git_provider, initial_message: {content: [{type: "text", text}]}}`. POST to `/api/v1/app-conversations` with `X-Access-Token: $OH_API_KEY` header. Returned start task `d419a19f` in `WORKING` → polled the conversations-search endpoint (NOT `/start-tasks/search` which 404s with HTML) → conv `5c05fff` appeared `running` / `RUNNING` after ~10s. **Note for future cycles**: `/api/v1/start-tasks/{id}` and `/api/v1/start-tasks/search` both return the SPA HTML, NOT JSON — use `/api/v1/app-conversations/search?selected_repository=...` and filter by recency / title-prefix instead.
- Worklog size: **1577 lines** pre-entry. **Still deferring truncation** — impl worker just spawned will write a hand-off entry on its completion (15-45 min from now); truncating mid-flight risks merge conflict on its push. The "first post-#153-merge idle cycle" target the merge worker set still stands; deferring to whichever orchestrator cycle has both slots empty post-impl-completion. **If next cycle is also productive, force truncate then regardless** (this is the threshold the previous orchestrator self-imposed at the 04:20Z cycle).

**Auto-disable counter:** **0 → 0.** Productive cycle. **Thirty-eighth consecutive productive cycle.** Not at risk.

**Next cycle expectations (~05:20-05:30Z window):**

- Impl worker `5c05fff` likely still `running` (typical impl for sibling PRs #150 and #153 ran ~30-90 min; this one is a 3-file flag-thread plus tests, on the easier side of that range). Plausible cycle-2 finish at ~05:50Z.
- If finished and PR opened DRAFT → orchestrator decision tree row: *"PR exists, draft, CI green → Wait (impl worker finishing up)"* → log status, exit. If PR is `ready` post-`gh pr ready` → next decision is whether docs update is needed.
- **Docs question for #125**: this PR introduces a **NEW CLI flag** (`--include-sub-conversations`) → matches the skill's "New flags or options" trigger. **Docs worker WILL be required** before testing. The expansion's verbatim help-text sentence and the docstring update are in the brief, but the README likely needs a `gen objs/titles/run` example update too. Plan: next cycle after PR is ready & CI green → **spawn docs worker**.
- Expansion slot stays idle (no issues need expansion; backlog remains the 5 ready issues after #125 enters PR pipeline: #127, #128, #145, #148, #149).
- If impl worker hits a blocker (e.g., DB migration ordering, filter symmetry tricky in FS fallback) → it should add `needs-info` and exit per the brief.

EXIT per orchestrate skill — one action per wake-up.

### 2026-05-30 05:12 UTC - Impl worker (#125 gen objs/titles/run root grain)

🚧 **Opened PR #154** — `feat(gen): exclude sub-conversations from multi-conv mode by default (#125)`

- **PR**: [#154](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/pull/154) — `feat/gen-roots-only-125` → `main`
- **Issue**: [#125](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/issues/125) — `gen objs/titles/run` multi-conv mode treats sub-conversations as independent units of human intent
- **CI status at hand-off**: ✅ lint=SUCCESS (3s), ✅ pytest=SUCCESS (53s), pr-review skipping while draft → will run on ready transition
- **State**: marked **ready for review** at 05:12Z

**Shape**: 7 files, +990 / -47. Threaded `include_sub_conversations: bool` (default `False`) through the existing pipeline rather than adding a mirror method — `ConversationStore.list_by_date_range(include_subs=False)` → `ohtv.conversations.get_conversations(include_subs=False)` → `cli._load_all_conversations(include_subs=False)` → `cli._apply_conversation_filters(include_sub_conversations=False)` → all three `gen` subcommands take a `--include-sub-conversations` Click flag. Docstrings updated. `list` and `refs` pass `include_sub_conversations=True` explicitly to preserve pre-#127 display behavior.

**Implementation contract followed**: Option B from the expansion comment (flag-threaded), per gating-question answers. The DB predicate is `id = root_conversation_id` — the same shape #124 (velocity) uses, NOT a join through the `conversations_by_root` view (the gen pipeline doesn't need subtree quantitative roll-ups, only row selection). The migration-020 presence guard mirrors #123/#124's `RuntimeError("<command> requires migration 020; run 'ohtv db scan' to apply pending migrations")` template, fires only when `include_subs=False` is requested — so legacy `list`/`refs` callers passing `include_subs=True` bypass the guard cleanly.

**Test coverage**: +24 new tests, 0 regressions. Full unit suite: **2063 passed, 2 skipped, 3 xfailed** (baseline @ `541b8d6` was 2039 + 24 = 2063).

| Test file | Class | Tests |
|---|---|---|
| `tests/unit/db/stores/test_conversation_store.py` | `TestListByDateRangeIncludeSubs` | 8 |
| `tests/unit/test_cli_gen.py` | `TestBatchModeSubConversations` | 6 |
| `tests/unit/test_cli_gen_titles.py` | `TestGenTitlesSubConversations` | 5 |
| `tests/unit/test_cli_gen_run.py` | `TestGenRunSubConversations` | 5 |

**AC verification table:**

| AC | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `gen objs/titles/run` default to roots only | ✅ | DB predicate + flag default |
| `--include-sub-conversations` opts back in | ✅ | All 3 commands, identical help text |
| Single-conv `gen objs <id>` unchanged | ✅ | Bypass at lines 8281–8292 untouched |
| Filter pipeline threads flag end-to-end | ✅ | DB tests + CLI tests both verify |
| Filesystem fallback honours flag | ✅ | `_get_conversations_from_db` + FS path symmetric |
| Migration-020 guard mirrors #123/#124 | ✅ | `_assert_root_column_present_for_list("gen")` |
| `list` / `refs` preserve pre-#127 behavior | ✅ | Explicit `include_sub_conversations=True` |
| Cache keys unchanged | ✅ | Per gating-question #5 |
| Help text advertises flag + default | ✅ | Tested on all 3 subcommands |
| No `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer | ✅ | Default-correctness fix per cluster contract |

**Cluster context for next orchestrator**:

| PR | Issue | Status | Release |
|---|---|---|---|
| #150 | #123 weekly-counts | merged | v0.16.1 |
| #153 | #124 velocity | merged | v0.16.2 |
| **#154** | **#125 gen objs/titles/run** | **draft → ready 05:12Z** | **→ v0.17.0 (next minor, `feat:`)** |
| TBD | #126 classification policy | PR #146 (separate cluster) | — |
| TBD | #127 list/refs display roll-up | open | — |
| TBD | #128 RAG citation dedup | open | — |

**What the next orchestrator should look for**:

1. **CI on the ready transition**: lint + pytest should re-run cleanly (passed once already on the draft). `pr-review` should now run.
2. **Likely `pr-review` outcome**: this PR is shape-similar to #150 (which got `🟢 Good taste`) and #153 (which merged cleanly) — same cluster pattern (predicate guard + flag threading + ~25 tests). High confidence in a clean approval.
3. **No human input needed**: no `needs-info` label set, no `## INSTRUCTION:` posted.
4. **Test/merge flow**: standard `qa → review → merge` chain per the orchestrate decision tree. Once merged, semantic-release will bump to `ohtv-v0.17.0` (first `feat:` since v0.16.x's `fix:` series).
5. **Docs**: this PR introduces a NEW CLI flag → matches the docs-worker trigger. README likely needs a `gen objs/titles/run` example update for the new flag. The expansion brief notes this. Plan: docs worker after `pr-review` approves.
6. **Follow-on `_seed_two_weeks` caveat from PR #152's worklog**: this PR's tests already use `root_conversation_id = id` correctly (the `TestListByDateRangeIncludeSubs` fixtures upsert through `ConversationStore`, which resolves roots), so no migration-of-test-helpers debt is being created for #127/#128.

EXIT — docs/testing/review/merge handling is a separate conversation per orchestrate skill.

### 2026-05-30 05:21 UTC - Orchestrator

**Active Workers (at cycle exit):**
| Conv ID   | Type | Working On                                           | Status          |
|-----------|------|------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| `eec0de5` | docs | PR #154 — `--include-sub-conversations` (#125)       | **NEW** running |

📚 **Spawned: Docs Worker for PR #154**

- **PR**: [#154](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/pull/154) — `feat(gen): exclude sub-conversations from multi-conv mode by default (#125)`
- **Branch**: `feat/gen-roots-only-125`
- **Conversation**: [`eec0de5`](https://app.all-hands.dev/conversations/eec0de5161204b8b91e3cbbed1a60308) — `execution_status=running`, `sandbox_status=RUNNING`, repo+branch+pr_number all wired (start task `36ca786d`, READY after ~10s).
- **Cluster slot**: 3rd of the #122 root-grain rollout series (docs leg of the #125 PR; siblings #150→v0.16.1 and #153→v0.16.2 already shipped).

**Current State (at cycle entry):**

- **Open PRs (1)**:
  - **#154** — `feat/gen-roots-only-125`, ready (not draft), createdAt 05:10:16Z, all CI green:
    - lint = SUCCESS, pytest = SUCCESS, pr-review (initial skip + 2nd run) = SUCCESS
    - `mergeable=MERGEABLE` / `mergeStateStatus=CLEAN`
    - `reviewDecision=CHANGES_REQUESTED` — pr-review bot left 🟡 *Acceptable - Works but needs breaking change acknowledgment* at 05:15:56Z (Run [#26675370883](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/actions/runs/26675370883))
    - Changed files: `cli.py`, `conversations.py`, `db/stores/conversation_store.py`, 4 test files — **README/docs NOT touched**.
    - 0 issue comments, 0 manual test reports.
- **Issues needing expansion**: 0 (all open issues are `ready` or `hold`).
- **Ready issues (5 remaining post-#125-in-PR)**: #127, #128 (priority:medium); #145, #148, #149 (no priority).
- **Recent main history**: `541b8d6` chore(release): ohtv 0.16.2 [skip ci] → `1f7b946` chore(worklog): merge worker shipped #153 → `c79ffde` fix(reports): velocity root grain (#124).

**Decision-tree trace this cycle:**

- **Step 1 — Human INSTRUCTION check**: 0 unacknowledged (`awk '/^\`\`\`/{f=!f;next} !f && /^## INSTRUCTION:/{print}' WORKLOG.md` → empty).
- **Step 2 — Active workers**: At entry, only this orchestrator conv (`9ca49e5`) was newly created and the prior impl worker `5c05fff` for PR #154 was terminal (status null in search, last hand-off entry at 05:12Z). **Both slots CLEAR at cycle entry.**
- **Expansion slot**: OPEN. `gh issue list … (ready or hold) | not` → empty. Slot stays **IDLE**. 28th consecutive idle expansion cycle, but PR slot productive this cycle → no auto-disable risk.
- **PR slot**: OPEN at entry. PR #154 present. Matched first eligible decision-tree row: ***"PR exists, ready, CI green, README not updated → Spawn docs worker"***.
  - Re-evaluation of the rows in order:
    - "README not updated" → ✅ matches first (no README/docs file in PR diff; PR introduces NEW CLI flag `--include-sub-conversations` and changed default → AGENTS.md/skill's "New flags or options" + "Changed default behavior" triggers).
    - "docs updated, no manual test results" → would match next cycle once docs lands.
    - "test results valid, 💬 > 0" → would match AFTER docs+test, when review worker addresses the CHANGES_REQUESTED feedback.
  - The pr-review CHANGES_REQUESTED verdict is **explicitly NOT** the trigger for skipping docs/testing — the skill's "Test what's documented" principle means docs/test gates are run regardless of review state.

**pr-review feedback carry-over for next review worker** (this orchestrator surfaces it now so the next cycle has it ready):

1. **CRITICAL — semver classification**: bot says default-change in `gen objs/titles/run` IS a breaking change (users running `gen objs --all` over `100 roots + 50 subs` previously got 150 results, now get 100). Two options offered:
   - **Option A**: add `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer to squash-merge commit (semantic-release will bump to **`v1.0.0`** instead of `v0.17.0`).
   - **Option B**: invert the rollout — opt-in via `--exclude-sub-conversations` with deprecation warning, flip default in a later release.
2. **IMPROVEMENT — silent FS fallback**: `src/ohtv/conversations.py` L72-76: filesystem-fallback path silently reverts to legacy behavior with only DEBUG-level log. Suggest upgrading to WARNING or surfacing inconsistency to user.
3. Reviewer notes test coverage as **excellent** (24 new tests, all passing), implementation as **clean**.

**Sibling-contrast tracker** (carried + updated):

| # | Surface | Fix style | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| #123 | `report weekly-counts` | predicate in `WHERE` | shipped `v0.16.1` |
| #124 | `report velocity` | DISTINCT-keyed-on-root | shipped `v0.16.2` |
| **#125** | `gen objs/titles/run` | flag-threaded predicate | **PR #154 in docs leg** |
| #126 | `classify` policy | sub→`automation` short-circuit | (separate cluster, was #146/v?) |
| #127 | `list`/`refs` display | (roll-up UX) | not started |
| #128 | RAG `ask`/`search` dedup | (`EmbeddingStore.search_conversations`) | not started |

**Housekeeping done this cycle:**

- **Worklog truncated**: 1723 → 1066 lines. Archived 8 entries from the 18:51-21:50Z May-29 productive window to `WORKLOG_ARCHIVE_2026-05-29.md` (already existed, appended). Kept 19 entries spanning ~6.3 hours of productive work (22:50Z May 29 → 05:12Z May 30) per skill's 6-hour-productive-window rule. The prior orchestrator's "first productive cycle after #153 merges, force-truncate regardless" trigger fired exactly as planned.
- **Tool setup**: `uv pip install --system git+...` for `lxa`/`ohtv` failed (read-only `/usr/local/lib/python3.13`). Did NOT chase a workaround — `gh` is the only tool this cycle needed (GH is the orchestrator's source of truth per skill). The prior orchestrator's `uv tool install` workaround is the recommended path if a future cycle needs `ohtv list`/`ohtv sync` (board was non-persistent anyway last cycle).
- **Spawn payload**: re-used the validated shape from prior cycle (`initial_message.content[].type=text`, `selected_repository`, `selected_branch`, `git_provider=github`, `pr_number=[154]`, `plugins=[ohtv-workflow@feat/ohtv-workflow-plugin]`). Polled via `/app-conversations/search?selected_repository=…` (the prior cycle confirmed `/start-tasks/search` returns SPA HTML, not JSON).

**Auto-disable counter:** **0 → 0.** Productive cycle (docs worker spawned, terminal action on PR #154). **Thirty-ninth consecutive productive cycle.** Not at risk.

**Next cycle expectations (~05:45-06:00Z window):**

- Docs worker `eec0de5` typical turnaround for a docs leg: 10-25 min (smaller surface than impl). Likely `finished` by next cycle.
- After commit + push, lint+pytest re-run (expected SUCCESS — no .py changes); pr-review re-runs (may re-flag the breaking-change concern with the same verdict since underlying code hasn't moved).
- Decision-tree row matched next cycle: ***"PR exists, ready, CI green, docs updated, no manual test results → Spawn testing worker"***. Manual test report should verify both:
  - Documented examples (`ohtv gen objs --week` roots-only default + `--include-sub-conversations` opt-in) match observed behavior on all 3 subcommands.
  - Migration-020 guard fires correctly when DB is at < 020.
- If docs worker hits a snag (e.g., docs/guides/analysis.md has a structural issue the brief didn't anticipate, or CI flakes on the docs push) → expect a `needs-info` label or fallback note in WORKLOG.md.
- After testing, decision-tree row matched: ***"test results valid, 💬 > 0 → review worker"***. Review worker will face the semver-classification choice (option A vs B). Per the prior orchestrator's expected-bump-to-v0.17.0 note: if option A wins, next release will be **v1.0.0** instead.

EXIT per orchestrate skill — one action per wake-up.

### 2026-05-30 05:30 UTC - Docs worker (#125 / PR #154)

📚 **Docs updated for PR #154** — `--include-sub-conversations` flag now documented.

- **Branch**: `feat/gen-roots-only-125`
- **Commit**: [`7b37cec`](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/commit/7b37cec) — `docs: update for --include-sub-conversations flag (#125)`
- **PR comment**: [#154 (comment-4581802236)](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/pull/154#issuecomment-4581802236)
- **CI re-run on push**: lint=SUCCESS (3s), pytest=PENDING at hand-off (started 05:29Z, no .py changes → expected SUCCESS), pr-review will re-run.

**Doc surface touched (3 files, +58 / -2)**:

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `README.md` | Sync bullet split into two sentences. First keeps the #108 reference for "subs are synced by default"; second adds "analysis and report commands then roll up to root conversations by default" and names `--include-sub-conversations` as the `gen objs / titles / run` batch-mode opt-in. Scope is explicit: the flag is gen-family only — report commands roll up at the SQL level (no flag). |
| `docs/guides/analysis.md` | Added a `> **Roots-only default**` callout block under each of `gen objs` (multi-conv), `gen titles`, and `gen run`, plus a copy-pasteable default + `--include-sub-conversations` example pair under each. Each subcommand's options table gained the new flag row with the verbatim help text. The `gen objs` callout explicitly notes that single-conv `ohtv gen objs <id>` is **unaffected** — flag is multi-only. |
| `docs/guides/automation.md` | Brief note after the nightly cron recipe (which uses `ohtv gen objs --quiet`) explaining the default change and the opt-in flag, with a link back to `analysis.md`. |

**Deliberately not touched** (per brief):

- `docs/guides/syncing.md` — the `gen titles` mention there is part of the lock-contract discussion, not the scope/grain discussion. The scope change is orthogonal to the writer-mutex contract.
- `docs/reference/cli.md` — command-table rows don't carry flag detail; the analysis.md link is sufficient.
- `docs/guides/getting-started.md` — the `ohtv gen objs` quick example is a beginner walkthrough; flag callout would dilute the 5-minute tour.
- `docs/contributing/manual-qa-pr18.md` — historical QA file for PR #18, not maintained.
- CLI `--help` text — already authored by impl worker; analysis.md flag-table row uses the same verbatim wording (`"Include sub-conversations created by agent delegation (default: roots only)"`).
- The pr-review CHANGES_REQUESTED thread — explicitly the **next review worker's** job per the brief; documented current behavior as implemented (excluded by default).

**Sibling-contrast note for next worker**: Neither PR #150 (#123) nor PR #153 (#124) shipped accompanying doc commits — those changes were SQL-layer aggregations with no user-visible CLI surface. PR #154 is the **first** root-grain rollout entry that ships a user-facing CLI flag, so it's also the first that warranted a docs update. The `> Roots-only default` callout shape established in this commit is the proposed pattern for #127's display roll-up docs, if a similar callout is needed there.

**What testing worker should verify**:

1. `ohtv gen objs --week` (no flag) → working set excludes agent-delegated sub-conversations (matches the new callout in `analysis.md`).
2. `ohtv gen objs --week --include-sub-conversations` → working set includes subs (pre-#125 behavior, matches the second example).
3. Same default / opt-in pair for `ohtv gen titles --week` and `ohtv gen run reports.weekly --last 4`.
4. `ohtv gen objs <id>` (single-conv form) is unaffected by the flag (the README + analysis.md callout both state this).
5. `ohtv gen objs --help`, `ohtv gen titles --help`, `ohtv gen run --help` all emit the verbatim help line `"Include sub-conversations created by agent delegation (default: roots only)"` for the new flag (matches the analysis.md options tables).

EXIT per docs-worker pattern — testing worker handles the next step.

### 2026-05-30 05:50 UTC - Orchestrator

**Active Workers:**
| Conv ID | Type | Working On | Status |
|---------|------|------------|--------|
| `e2f465f` | testing | PR #154 — `--include-sub-conversations` (#125) | **NEW** running |

**Spawned: Testing Worker**
- PR: [#154 — feat(gen): exclude sub-conversations from multi-conv mode by default (#125)](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/pull/154)
- Branch: `feat/gen-roots-only-125`
- Conversation: [`e2f465f`](https://app.all-hands.dev/conversations/e2f465f)
- Start task id: `3a6e225b68964f059daba95d399e9dcf` → `WORKING` → conversation observed `running` within 30s
- Plugin: `github:jpshackelford/.openhands/plugins/ohtv-workflow@feat/ohtv-workflow-plugin`

**State at wake-up:**

- **Step 0/0.5 — Setup + housekeeping**: `gh` available via `GH_TOKEN=$github_token` shim (the spawn-skill examples assume `$OH_API_KEY` and bare `gh`; this conversation has `OPENHANDS_API_KEY` for spawn + `github_token` for gh — matches the prior cycle's working pattern). `lxa`/`ohtv` not installed this cycle — not needed (GH is the source of truth per skill, and the prior orchestrator's note flagged that local `ohtv` board is non-persistent across cron wake-ups). WORKLOG.md is at **1190 lines** — over the 300-line truncation threshold, but the **prior orchestrator (05:14Z entry) explicitly took the truncation pass this cycle** (`1723 → 1066`) and we're only `+124` lines on top. Deferring next truncation per the "first productive cycle after #153 merges, force-truncate regardless" trigger which already fired. **Next truncation candidate**: cycle after PR #154 merges, same trigger.
- **Step 1 — Human INSTRUCTION check**: 0 unacknowledged (`awk '/^```/{f=!f;next} !f && /^## INSTRUCTION:/{print}' WORKLOG.md` → empty).
- **Step 2/3 — Active workers**: prior docs worker `eec0de5` queried → `finished` at 05:26Z. No other running conversations (the only `running` row in `/app-conversations/search` filtered to this repo was `9f42bd0` = self). Both slots free at wake-up.
- **Step 4 — Open PRs**: 1 — PR #154 (`feat/gen-roots-only-125`).
- **Step 4 — PR #154 status**:
  - Not draft, `reviewDecision = CHANGES_REQUESTED` (pr-review bot, breaking-change concern from 05:15Z).
  - CI: `lint=SUCCESS` (3s), `pytest=SUCCESS` — both passed on the latest `7b37cec` push (the docs commit).
  - Head SHA `7b37cec`, last commit at 05:24:44Z.
  - PR comments: 1 (the docs-update notification from `7b37cec`).
  - PR reviews: 1 (the github-actions CHANGES_REQUESTED).
  - **No manual test report yet** (searched comments for "Manual Test Results" — none).
- **Step 4 — Issue census**:
  - Issues needing expansion (no `ready`, no `hold`): **0**.
  - Ready, prioritized: #125 (priority:medium, PR #154 in flight), #127 (priority:medium), #128 (priority:medium).
  - Ready, unprioritized: #145, #148, #149 (the prior cycles flagged #148 as the candidate; #145/#149 are new-prompt-pipeline work that's queued behind the root-grain cluster).

**Decision tree path:**

- Expansion slot: 0 issues need expansion → **slot idle**, nothing to spawn.
- PR slot: PR #154 → ready, CI green, **docs updated** (`7b37cec` + the docs-update comment from worker `eec0de5`), **no manual test results** → ***"Spawn testing worker"***. ✓ matched.
- Decision-tree note: even though `reviewDecision = CHANGES_REQUESTED`, the skill explicitly states *"Even if this PR already has review comments, testing is still required. Testing gates the review process — reviewers need to see what was tested before approving."* — so testing comes before re-review.

**Testing worker brief (key elements)**:

The prompt cites the docs worker's 5-item verification checklist verbatim (WORKLOG entry 2026-05-30 05:30 UTC):
1. `ohtv gen objs --week` (no flag) → excludes subs (matches `> Roots-only default` callout in `docs/guides/analysis.md`).
2. `--include-sub-conversations` → includes subs (legacy / pre-#125 behavior).
3. Same default / opt-in for `gen titles --week` + `gen run reports.weekly --last 4`.
4. Single-conv `ohtv gen objs <id>` is **unaffected** (per README + analysis.md callout).
5. `--help` for all 3 commands emits the verbatim help line `"Include sub-conversations created by agent delegation (default: roots only)"`.

Also flagged as best-effort: migration-020 guard sanity (DB at < 020 should refuse `gen objs --week`; DB at ≥ 020 should not).

Explicit non-goals for the worker:
- **Not** addressing the breaking-change review thread (semver A vs B carry-forward from prior cycles is the review worker's call, see WORKLOG entries 03:32Z / 05:14Z).
- **Not** running the review pass — testing only.

**Spawn payload shape** (re-used from validated prior cycle):
- `initial_message.content[].type=text`, `run=true`.
- `selected_repository=jpshackelford/ohtv`, `selected_branch=feat/gen-roots-only-125`, `git_provider=github`.
- `pr_number=[154]`.
- `plugins=[github:jpshackelford/.openhands plugins/ohtv-workflow @feat/ohtv-workflow-plugin]`.
- POST returned `status=WORKING`, polled `/app-conversations/search?selected_repository=jpshackelford/ohtv` after 30s → `e2f465f execution_status=running` confirmed.

**Sibling-contrast tracker** (unchanged from prior cycle):

| # | Surface | Fix style | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| #123 | `report weekly-counts` | predicate in `WHERE` | shipped `v0.16.1` |
| #124 | `report velocity` | DISTINCT-keyed-on-root | shipped `v0.16.2` |
| **#125** | `gen objs/titles/run` | flag-threaded predicate | **PR #154 in testing leg** |

| #127 | `list`/`refs` display | (roll-up UX) | not started |
| #128 | RAG `ask`/`search` dedup | (`EmbeddingStore.search_conversations`) | not started |

**Auto-disable counter:** **0 → 0.** Productive cycle (spawned testing worker, terminal action on PR #154). **Fortieth consecutive productive cycle.** Not at risk.

**Next cycle expectations (~06:20-06:30Z window):**

- Testing worker `e2f465f` typical turnaround for a testing leg with `uv sync` + checklist + pytest: **15-30 min**. Likely `finished` by next cycle (target ~06:05-06:20Z).
- After test report comment posts, decision-tree row matched next cycle: ***"PR exists, ready, CI green, test results valid, 💬 > 0 → review worker"***. Review worker will face the **semver-classification choice (option A: bump to v1.0.0 as breaking; option B: opt-in flag rollout with `--exclude-sub-conversations` deprecation)** as carried forward from the pr-review bot's first review.
- If testing surfaces a behavior gap that contradicts the docs (e.g., a `--help` text mismatch, or migration-020 guard not firing) → expect testing worker to post `❌` items in the report and the next orchestrator wake-up will need to dispatch an impl-fix worker before review. Per the docs worker's hand-off, the highest-risk item is the migration-020 guard (worker may have to skip if test harness can't reach a DB with both subs + at-migration-020 state).
- **Expected release on merge**: per the prior orchestrator's note, the semver decision rides on the review worker's verdict — **v0.17.0** (option B) or **v1.0.0** (option A). `python-semantic-release` will execute that bump within ~30s of the squash-merge.
- If testing worker's report is **all ✓** with no fix-required items → review worker becomes the immediate next dispatch, and the option A/B decision is the only blocker between here and merge.

EXIT per orchestrate skill — one action per wake-up.

### 2026-05-30 06:19 UTC - Orchestrator

**Active Workers:**
| Conv ID | Type | Working On | Status |
|---------|------|------------|--------|
| `e2f465f` | testing | PR #154 — `--include-sub-conversations` (#125) | running |

✅ **PR slot occupied, expansion slot idle (nothing to expand)** — no action this cycle.

**State at wake-up:**

- **Step 1 — Human INSTRUCTION check**: 0 unacknowledged.
- **Step 2 — Active workers**: `e2f465f` (testing PR #154) queried → `execution_status=running`, `updated_at=2026-05-30T06:17:39Z` (mid-cycle, ~1 min before this wake-up). Worker is **alive and progressing**. The other `running` row in the search response (`90859fc`) is this orchestrator conversation itself.
- **Step 4 — Open PRs**: 1 — PR #154 (`feat/gen-roots-only-125`).
- **PR #154 snapshot**:
  - Not draft, `reviewDecision = CHANGES_REQUESTED` (pr-review bot's breaking-change concern from 05:15Z — unchanged).
  - CI: `lint=SUCCESS`, `pytest=SUCCESS` (both on docs-commit `7b37cec`).
  - `commentCount=1` (the docs-update notification); **no `Manual Test Results` comment yet** — testing worker hasn't posted its report.
  - `mergeable=UNKNOWN` (transient GH state, not a blocker).
- **Step 4 — Issue census**:
  - Issues needing expansion (no `ready`, no `hold`): **0**.
  - Ready, prioritized: #125 (in PR #154), #127, #128 (all `priority:medium`).
  - Ready, unprioritized: #145, #148, #149.

**Decision tree path:**

- **Expansion slot**: 0 issues need expansion → slot **idle**. **29th consecutive idle expansion cycle**, but PR slot is occupied with active in-flight work → no auto-disable risk.
- **PR slot**: `!CAN_SPAWN_PR_WORKER` (testing worker still running) → row matches ***"Wait (PR worker running)"***. No spawn.

**Auto-disable check**: Prior 2 cycles (05:14Z docs spawn, 05:50Z testing spawn) were both **productive**. The skill's auto-disable trigger requires "two consecutive 'All quiet' entries"; this entry is a no-spawn cycle but it's *waiting on active work*, not an idle-both-slots quiet. Per the skill's intent (avoid useless wake-ups when there's literally no work to do), the spirit is **not** triggered — there's a worker we're explicitly waiting on. Counter logic: no change. **Forty-first consecutive cycle with progress on the system.** Not at risk.

**Worklog housekeeping**: 1276 lines (above 300 threshold). Prior orchestrator (05:14Z) executed the cycle's truncation pass (1723 → 1066 lines). This cycle is only `+210` lines on top, and the trigger established by the prior cycles is *"first productive cycle after PR #154 merges, force-truncate regardless"*. Truncating mid-PR while testing report is imminent would lose context the review worker needs. **Deferring** per the established pattern.

**Sibling-contrast tracker** (unchanged):

| # | Surface | Fix style | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| #123 | `report weekly-counts` | predicate in `WHERE` | shipped `v0.16.1` |
| #124 | `report velocity` | DISTINCT-keyed-on-root | shipped `v0.16.2` |
| **#125** | `gen objs/titles/run` | flag-threaded predicate | **PR #154 in testing leg** |
| #126 | `classify` policy | sub→`automation` short-circuit | (separate cluster) |
| #127 | `list`/`refs` display | (roll-up UX) | not started |
| #128 | RAG `ask`/`search` dedup | (`EmbeddingStore.search_conversations`) | not started |

**Next cycle expectations (~06:45-07:00Z window):**

- Testing worker `e2f465f` was spawned at 05:50Z, was last updated at 06:17:39Z — turnaround so far ~28 min on the 15-30 min envelope. Likely `finished` by next wake-up with a manual test report comment posted.
- If test report is **all ✓** → decision-tree row matches ***"test results valid, 💬 > 0 → review worker"***. Review worker will face the **semver-classification A-vs-B** decision (option A: `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer → v1.0.0; option B: invert to opt-in `--exclude-sub-conversations` with deprecation warning → v0.17.0).
- If test report flags a regression (most likely candidates: `--help` text mismatch with docs, or migration-020 guard not firing on a pre-020 DB) → next dispatch is an impl-fix worker before review.
- Carry-forward review-worker brief (from 05:14Z entry): (1) breaking-change footer or opt-in invert, (2) FS-fallback warning level in `conversations.py` L72-76.

EXIT per orchestrate skill — one decision per wake-up; this one was "no action, wait on `e2f465f`".

### 2026-05-30 06:23 UTC - Testing worker (#125 / PR #154)

**Active Workers:**
| Conv ID | Type | Working On | Status |
|---------|------|------------|--------|
| `e2f465f` | testing | PR #154 — `--include-sub-conversations` (#125) | completed |

**Outcome:** ✅ All 9 scenarios PASS. Manual test report posted at [comment #4581947363](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/pull/154#issuecomment-4581947363).

**Verification checklist results (from 05:30Z docs hand-off):**

| # | Check | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `gen objs --week` default excludes subs | ✅ | Seed: 1 root + 2 subs at 2099-01-15; `--since 2099-01-01 --until 2099-12-31 -y` → `Showing 0 of 1` |
| 2 | `gen objs --week --include-sub-conversations` includes subs | ✅ | Same filter + flag → `Showing 0 of 3` |
| 3 | Same default / opt-in pair for `gen titles` | ✅ | `--all-titled` → `1 selected conversation(s)`; with flag → `3 selected conversation(s)` |
| 3 | Same default / opt-in pair for `gen run reports.weekly` | ✅ | Both invocations complete; selection plumbed via same `_apply_conversation_filters` proven in #1–#2. Couldn't show row-level 1-vs-3 because aggregate counts cached source results and the seed has no on-disk content — documented in report |
| 4 | `gen objs <id>` single-conv form unaffected by flag | ✅ | Real cloud id `eec0de5161204b8b91e3cbbed1a60308` — byte-identical output with/without flag |
| 5 | Verbatim help text on all three commands | ✅ | `"Include sub-conversations created by agent delegation (default: roots only)"` matches docs; Click wraps after `delegation` |
| — | Migration-020 guard fires on stale DB | ✅ | `RuntimeError("gen requires migration 020; run 'ohtv db scan' to apply pending migrations")` at store boundary |
| — | Migration-020 present → no guard | ✅ | All CLI tests run cleanly on the 1,603-row DB with migration 020 applied |
| — | Full unit suite | ✅ | `2063 passed, 2 skipped, 3 xfailed` in 37.49s (includes the new `TestListByDateRangeIncludeSubs` cluster) |

**Test methodology note:** Real synced data on this account has **0 subs** in the 1,600 recent conversations (the 2 known subs in `cloud_listing` belong to unrelated accounts and don't sync into our trees). To exercise the flag with controllable parent/root metadata, I DB-seeded a triplet (`test125root` + `test125sub*a000` + `test125sub*b000`) at `created_at=2099-01-15`, then used `--since 2099-01-01 --until 2099-12-31` to isolate exactly that triplet through the CLI. The CLI surface is what was under test; the seeding was setup. This is consistent with PR #153's "synthetic fixtures" approach.

**Out-of-scope (correctly):**

- Breaking-change review thread from `pr-review[bot]` at 05:15Z (semver A-vs-B) — left for the review worker per orchestrator's decision tree.
- FS-fallback `log.debug` vs `log.warning` discussion in `conversations.py` L72-76 — carry-forward for review worker.

**Hand-off:** Per the 06:19Z orchestrator's "next cycle expectations": test report is **all ✓** → decision-tree row matches *"test results valid, 💬 > 0 → review worker"*. Review worker can proceed with the semver-classification call on the next cycle.

EXIT.

### 2026-05-30 06:49 UTC - Orchestrator

**Active Workers:**
| Conv ID | Type | Working On | Status |
|---------|------|------------|--------|
| `7220b3d` | review | PR #154 — `--include-sub-conversations` (#125) | **NEW** running |

**Spawned: Review Worker**
- PR: [#154 — feat(gen): exclude sub-conversations from multi-conv mode by default (#125)](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/pull/154)
- Branch: `feat/gen-roots-only-125`
- Conversation: [`7220b3d`](https://app.all-hands.dev/conversations/7220b3dcf6614a33bb0d35d24c2113d2)
- Start task id: `c9881c96…` → `READY` on first poll → `execution_status=running` + `sandbox_status=RUNNING` confirmed
- Plugin: `github:jpshackelford/.openhands/plugins/ohtv-workflow@feat/ohtv-workflow-plugin`

**State at wake-up:**

- **Step 0 — Setup**: `lxa` + `ohtv` installed into `.venv` (system Python was read-only). `lxa repo add jpshackelford/ohtv` re-created the "Unnamed Board 1" (consistent with prior-cycle note that the lxa board is non-persistent across cron wake-ups). Skipped `ohtv sync` — GH is the source of truth this cycle.
- **Step 0.5 — Worklog housekeeping**: WORKLOG.md at **1370 lines** (above 300 threshold). Prior cycles (05:14Z full truncation 1723→1066; 06:19Z deferred) established the trigger as *"first productive cycle after PR #154 merges, force-truncate regardless"*. PR #154 still in flight → **deferring** truncation again. Will execute on the post-merge cycle as planned.
- **Step 1 — Human INSTRUCTION check**: 0 unacknowledged (`awk '/^```/{f=!f;next} !f && /^## INSTRUCTION:/{print}' WORKLOG.md` → empty).
- **Step 2/3 — Active workers**: testing worker `e2f465f` queried → `finished` at 06:23Z (and posted comment #4581947363 with all 9 ✅ before exiting). Search of `/app-conversations/search?selected_repository=jpshackelford/ohtv` filtered to `running` returned only `d4be3ec` = this orchestrator self. Both slots free at wake-up.
- **Step 4 — Open PRs**: 1 — PR #154 (`feat/gen-roots-only-125`).
- **Step 4 — PR #154 status**:
  - Not draft, `reviewDecision = CHANGES_REQUESTED` (pr-review bot, 05:15Z, unchanged).
  - CI: `lint=SUCCESS`, `pytest=SUCCESS` on head `7b37cec`.
  - 2 PR comments: (1) docs-update notification from `eec0de5` at 05:25Z, (2) `## Manual Test Results for PR #154` from testing worker `e2f465f` at 06:23Z — all 9 scenarios PASS, full unit suite `2063 passed, 2 skipped, 3 xfailed`.
  - 1 review (the pr-review bot CHANGES_REQUESTED).
- **Step 4 — Issue census**:
  - Issues needing expansion: **0**.
  - Ready, prioritized: #125 (in PR #154), #127, #128 (all `priority:medium`).
  - Ready, unprioritized: #145, #148, #149.

**Decision tree path:**

- **Expansion slot**: 0 issues need expansion → slot idle. No spawn.
- **PR slot**: PR #154 → ready, CI green, docs updated, **test results valid (all ✓)**, 💬 = 1 review (CHANGES_REQUESTED) → row matches ***"PR exists, ready, CI green, test results valid, 💬 > 0 → review worker"***. ✓ matched. Spawned.

**Review worker brief (key elements)**:

The prompt carries forward both named threads from prior orchestrator cycles + the explicit option A/B framing:

1. **Semver classification** — the new `--include-sub-conversations` default flip excludes subs. Two options framed:
   - **Option A** (treat as breaking): add `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer to the squash-merge commit → python-semantic-release bumps to **v1.0.0**. Leave default as-is.
   - **Option B** (opt-in): rename to `--exclude-sub-conversations`, default to *including* subs (pre-#125 behavior), add `DeprecationWarning`, update help + README + analysis.md + test matrix. Bumps to **v0.17.0**.
   - **Context for the call**: siblings #123 (PR #150 → v0.16.1) and #124 (PR #153 → v0.16.2) shipped as patch bumps (SQL-only, no user-facing CLI). PR #154 is the first user-facing default flip in the #125–#128 root-grain cluster — the choice sets the pattern for #127/#128. Single-conv `gen objs <id>` is unaffected either way (confirmed in testing report).
2. **FS-fallback log level** — `src/ohtv/sources/conversations.py` L72–76 logs at `debug` when DB-fast-path falls back to FS scan; reviewer suggests `warning`. Worker to evaluate "is this a normal expected path on fresh installs (→ debug) or a real degradation (→ warning)" and either bump the level or document the rationale in the thread reply.

Workflow lock-down:
- Set PR back to draft immediately (`gh pr ready 154 --undo`).
- For each thread: implement-or-reject → logical commit → push → CI watch → GraphQL reply citing SHA → `resolveReviewThread`.
- After all threads resolved + CI green: `gh pr ready 154` (re-triggers pr-review bot).
- Worklog entry on `main` summarizing the option-A-vs-B call + FS-fallback decision.
- EXIT — next review round is a separate conversation.

Explicit non-goals:
- No re-testing — 06:23Z report stays current unless reviewer changes `src/` files (per orchestrate skill heuristic; if so, the *next* orchestrator wake-up dispatches a re-testing worker before pr-review bot).
- No merge — separate dispatch.

**Spawn payload shape** (validated):
- `selected_repository=jpshackelford/ohtv`, `selected_branch=feat/gen-roots-only-125`, `git_provider=github`.
- `pr_number=[154]`.
- `plugins=[github:jpshackelford/.openhands plugins/ohtv-workflow @feat/ohtv-workflow-plugin]`.
- `initial_message.content[].type=text`, `run=true`.
- POST `/api/v1/app-conversations` with `X-Access-Token: $OPENHANDS_API_KEY` → start task `c9881c96…` returned `status=WORKING`; poll `/start-tasks/search` → `READY` immediately (first poll, ~14s after POST); `app_conversation_id=7220b3dc…`; `/app-conversations?ids=7220b3dc…` confirmed `execution_status=running`, `sandbox_status=RUNNING`.

**Sibling-contrast tracker** (unchanged):

| # | Surface | Fix style | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| #123 | `report weekly-counts` | predicate in `WHERE` | shipped `v0.16.1` |
| #124 | `report velocity` | DISTINCT-keyed-on-root | shipped `v0.16.2` |
| **#125** | `gen objs/titles/run` | flag-threaded predicate | **PR #154 in review leg** |
| #126 | `classify` policy | sub→`automation` short-circuit | (separate cluster) |
| #127 | `list`/`refs` display | (roll-up UX) | not started |
| #128 | RAG `ask`/`search` dedup | (`EmbeddingStore.search_conversations`) | not started |

**Auto-disable counter:** **0 → 0.** Productive cycle (spawned review worker — terminal action on PR #154 review leg). **Forty-second consecutive productive cycle.** Not at risk.

**Next cycle expectations (~07:20Z window):**

- Review worker `7220b3d` turnaround: depends entirely on the semver option chosen. Option A is **fast** (single commit or PR-description edit + thread replies + resolve, ~15-20 min). Option B is **slow** (flag rename + invert default + deprecation warning + 5+ file updates + test re-runs, ~45-60 min and possibly two review rounds).
- If next-cycle status is `running` → wait.
- If next-cycle status is `finished` + new pr-review bot review → check `reviewDecision`:
  - `APPROVED` (test results valid, docs current, no significant `src/` changes) → ***"Spawn merge worker"***.
  - `APPROVED` (test results valid, `src/` changed substantially in review) → ***"Spawn re-testing worker"*** first.
  - `CHANGES_REQUESTED` again → ***"Spawn review worker (round 2)"***.
- The semver thread's outcome dictates whether the eventual squash-merge commit carries a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer. **Merge worker must read the review worker's worklog entry** before crafting the commit message.

EXIT per orchestrate skill — one action per wake-up.

### 2026-05-30 06:55 UTC - Review worker (PR #154 round 1 → ready-for-round-2)

_This entry was authored by an AI agent (OpenHands) on behalf of @jpshackelford._

**Scope:** Address PR #154 round-1 review (`pr-review[bot]`, CHANGES_REQUESTED @ 05:15Z). Three actionable threads identified — two inline + one top-level summary item.

**Threads + decisions:**

| # | Thread | File | Decision | Commit |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | FS-fallback `log.debug` → `log.warning` | `src/ohtv/conversations.py:72-76` | **Accepted.** Suggested wording used verbatim. FS path is the degraded-state branch — silently ignoring `include_subs=False` is exactly the silent-inconsistency the reviewer flagged. DB-first design keeps noise floor low. | `cd15dad` |
| 2 | `params: list[str] = []` redundant annotation | `src/ohtv/db/stores/conversation_store.py:318` | **Accepted.** Pure stylistic nit. `params = []` is enough; append sites constrain the type. | `cd15dad` |
| 3 | Missing `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer on default flip | top-level review summary (CRITICAL) | **Accepted (Option A).** Added empty footer commit `11f3523` + updated PR description. **See semver reasoning below.** | `11f3523` |

**Semver decision — chose Option A. Reasoning:**

1. The new behavior is the *correct* one (subs are agent work, not human intent) — shipping the right default sooner is better than a deprecation cycle. The review itself acknowledged this.
2. **`[tool.semantic_release] major_on_zero = false` in `pyproject.toml`** means the BREAKING footer ships this as **v0.17.0** (minor bump with a `⚠ BREAKING CHANGES` CHANGELOG entry), **not** v1.0.0 as the hand-off summary anticipated. The user-visible signal — the CHANGELOG entry — is exactly what the review asked for, without the scary version jump.
3. A deprecation cycle (Option B) would add a dual-write code path + `DeprecationWarning` on every gen-* invocation + a future flip-the-default release — significant machinery for a 0.x project where breaking changes are conventionally tolerated.
4. **Sets the pattern for #127 (list/refs display roll-up) and #128 (RAG citation dedup).** Each user-facing default flip in the root-grain cluster lands with a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer in 0.x. Once the cluster ships, the 1.0.0 graduation conversation can be a single coordinated decision rather than a per-PR debate.

**Hand-off correction noted in PR comment:** the hand-off summary said Option A would bump to v1.0.0. That's only true under `major_on_zero = true`. The project explicitly opts out with `major_on_zero = false` (with a comment in `pyproject.toml`: "Repo is pre-1.0 and we want to stay there"). Option A's actual outcome is **v0.17.0 with a `⚠ BREAKING CHANGES` CHANGELOG entry** — both options ship the same version, so the choice is really about deprecation-cycle complexity vs. acknowledge-and-ship.

**Commits pushed to `feat/gen-roots-only-125`:**

```
11f3523 docs: acknowledge gen multi-conv default flip as a breaking change
cd15dad fix: address PR #154 review feedback (warning level, type annotation)
7b37cec docs: update for --include-sub-conversations flag (#125)        ← round-1 head
```

`11f3523` is an empty (`--allow-empty`) commit whose sole purpose is to inject the `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer into the squash-merge body. The PR description was also updated to reproduce the footer at the bottom for belt-and-suspenders coverage of GitHub's body-construction strategy.

**CI status @ 06:55Z:**

- `lint`: ✅ pass (5s)
- `pytest`: ✅ pass (55s on head `11f3523`)

**Thread actions:**

- Inline thread 1 (`PRRT_kwDOR9seq86F1_EH`): reply posted, thread resolved.
- Inline thread 2 (`PRRT_kwDOR9seq86F1_EP`): reply posted, thread resolved.
- Top-level summary (semver): full reasoning posted as PR comment `#issuecomment-4582012978`; PR description rewritten to remove the now-incorrect "No new `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer" AC line and add a "Breaking change acknowledgment" section.

**PR state:**

- Was set to draft at round-1 start (`gh pr ready 154 --undo`).
- Now back to ready-for-review on commit `11f3523`.
- Re-triggers pr-review bot for round 2.

**For the next orchestrator wake-up:**

- Re-testing: **NOT required.** Code changes are (a) `log.debug` → `log.warning` (no behavior change at the CLI surface) and (b) a type-annotation deletion (no runtime effect). The 9-scenario test report posted at 06:23Z stays current.
- Expected next state: pr-review bot opens round 2 within ~10-15 min of the ready transition. Most likely outcomes:
  - **APPROVED** → orchestrator spawns merge worker. Merge worker should use squash strategy and **verify the squash commit body retains the `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer** (visible in commit `11f3523` and reproduced at the bottom of the PR description). Expected release: **v0.17.0** with `⚠ BREAKING CHANGES` CHANGELOG section.
  - **CHANGES_REQUESTED (round 2)** → orchestrator spawns another review worker. New threads to be evaluated then.

**Auto-disable counter:** **0 → 0** (productive — addressed 3 threads, pushed 2 commits, PR back in review queue).

EXIT.

- Conversation: [`fc23665`](https://app.all-hands.dev/conversations/fc23665bb2e341969eab8dbf8d78cc19)
- Start task: `6245cb83` → READY in ~15s, sandbox RUNNING.

**Why merge (decision-tree match):**

- **Step 1 — Human INSTRUCTION check**: 0 unacknowledged (`awk '/^```/{f=!f;next} !f && /^## INSTRUCTION:/{print}' WORKLOG.md` → empty).
- **Step 2/3 — Active workers**: Review worker `7220b3d` queried via `/app-conversations/search?selected_repository=jpshackelford/ohtv` filtered to `running` → only `f349efe` (self) returned. `7220b3d` is no longer running. Last entry from review worker at 06:55Z confirmed exit. Both slots free at wake-up.
- **Step 4 — Open PRs**: 1 — PR #154 (`feat/gen-roots-only-125`).
- **Step 4 — PR #154 status @ 07:16Z**:
  - Not draft, `reviewDecision = APPROVED` (pr-review bot, ~06:59Z).
  - `mergeStateStatus = CLEAN` (no conflicts, base up-to-date).
  - CI on head `11f35231`: `lint=SUCCESS`, `pytest=SUCCESS`, `pr-review=SUCCESS`.
  - Last 3 commits on branch: `7b37cec` (docs), `cd15dad` (review fixes), `11f35231` (BREAKING CHANGE empty footer).
- **Decision-tree walk** (in order):
  - "PR exists, draft" → ❌ (not draft).
  - "PR ready, CI green, README not updated" → ❌ (docs commit `7b37cec` already updated README).
  - "PR ready, CI green, docs updated, no manual test results" → ❌ (testing worker `e2f465f` posted 9-scenario report at 06:23Z, comment `#4581947363`).
  - "PR ready, CI green, test results outdated" → ❌. Changes since last test: `cd15dad` (log.debug → log.warning in degraded-FS fallback — no CLI surface impact) + `11f35231` (empty `--allow-empty` commit, runtime no-op). Per review worker's explicit hand-off note: *"Re-testing: NOT required. (a) log.debug → log.warning (no behavior change at the CLI surface), (b) type-annotation deletion (no runtime effect)."* 9-scenario report stays current.
  - "PR ready, CI green, test results valid, 💬 > 0" → ❌ (round-1 review threads were all resolved by review worker; `reviewDecision = APPROVED` now).
  - "PR ready, test results valid, good rating, docs outdated" → ❌ (no `src/` changes since the docs commit affect documented behavior; README still describes the flag correctly).
  - **"PR ready, test results valid, good rating, docs valid" → ✅ MATCH → Spawn merge worker.**

**Critical context injected into the merge worker's prompt:**

The merge worker MUST preserve the `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer (introduced by empty commit `11f35231`) in the squash-merge body. `pyproject.toml` pins `[tool.semantic_release] major_on_zero = false`, so the footer ships as **v0.17.0 with a ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES CHANGELOG entry — not v1.0.0**. The PR description was already rewritten by the round-1 review worker to reproduce the footer at the bottom for belt-and-suspenders coverage.

The prompt also instructs the worker to:
1. Read both the testing worker's report (`#4581947363`) and the review worker's semver-decision comment (`#4582012978`).
2. Verify on `main` after merge that the `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer survived (`gh api repos/.../commits/main --jq '.commit.message'`).
3. Watch `release.yml` workflow to confirm tag is `ohtv-v0.17.0` and release notes contain the `⚠ BREAKING CHANGES` section.
4. Log the merge outcome to WORKLOG.md on main with a `chore(release):` or `chore(worklog):` prefix to avoid triggering a duplicate release run.

**Expansion slot:**

- `gh issue list --state open` filtered to `(ready or hold) | not` → empty. **No issues need expansion.** 29th consecutive idle expansion cycle, but PR slot productive this cycle → no auto-disable risk.
- Ready issues queue: #149, #148, #145, #128 (priority:medium), #127 (priority:medium), #125 (priority:medium — being merged now). After #154 merges, #125 will close (`Fixes #125`) and the priority:medium queue becomes #127, #128. Both are part of the root-grain cluster, so the next implementation worker (post-merge) will pick from those.

**Next cycle expectations (~07:46Z window):**

- Merge worker `fc23665` turnaround: ~10-20 minutes (squash merge + verification + WORKLOG entry). Should be `finished` by next wake-up.
- After merge: semantic-release runs on `main`, ~30s end-to-end, produces tag `ohtv-v0.17.0` + GitHub Release with `⚠ BREAKING CHANGES` section.
- After `v0.17.0` ships:
  - No open PR → check ready+priority queue → #127 or #128 (both priority:medium, tie-break by issue number → **#127**).
  - Spawn implementation worker for #127 (`ohtv list` and `refs` surface sub-conversations as siblings of their roots).

**Worklog housekeeping note:** WORKLOG.md is now 1525+ lines (well past the 300-line truncation threshold). The orchestrate skill recommends running `/truncate-worklog` when this happens. Deferred this cycle to keep one productive action (merge spawn) per wake-up; flagging for a future cycle (likely after `v0.17.0` ships and before the #127 impl worker spawns, since that's a natural break-point).

**Auto-disable counter:** **0 → 0.** Productive cycle (spawned merge worker — terminal action that closes the PR #154 / Issue #125 leg of the root-grain cluster). **Forty-third consecutive productive cycle.** Not at risk.

EXIT per orchestrate skill — one action per wake-up.

**Late addendum (~07:22Z, before this entry was pushed):** While the orchestrator was preparing this WORKLOG entry, the merge worker `fc23665` raced ahead and squash-merged PR #154 as commit [`4f2217d`](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/commit/4f2217dc1aa64d996a5fc67ac99d00db384aade2) on `main`. Verified the squash commit body retained the `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer:

```
BREAKING CHANGE: ohtv gen objs/titles/run multi-conv mode now excludes
sub-conversations by default. Use --include-sub-conversations to restore
the pre-v1.0.0 behavior.
```

`release.yml` workflow run `26677937192` is now `in_progress` on head `4f2217d` (started 07:21:25Z). Next orchestrator wake-up should see the new `ohtv-v0.17.0` tag + `⚠ BREAKING CHANGES` CHANGELOG entry, after which the merge worker will likely push its own outcome entry to WORKLOG. If the merge worker's own entry doesn't appear by the next cycle, the orchestrator should write a follow-up confirming the v0.17.0 release before spawning the #127 impl worker.

### 2026-05-30 07:24 UTC - Merge worker (PR #154)

**Outcome: PR #154 merged, `ohtv-v0.17.0` released with `⚠ BREAKING CHANGES` section.**

**Merge execution:**

- Pre-flight check: PR `mergeStateStatus=CLEAN`, `reviewDecision=APPROVED`, head `11f35231`, all checks green (lint 5s, pytest 55s, pr-review 3m23s).
- PR description already carried the `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer at the bottom (review worker had rewritten it for belt-and-suspenders coverage). No description update needed.
- Squash subject: `feat(gen): exclude sub-conversations from multi-conv mode by default (#125) (#154)`. Body authored with the authoritative footer from commit [`11f35231`](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/commit/11f35231476b1bbccf6bd4ed594c6340bc24abff) verbatim, not a paraphrase.
- `gh pr merge 154 --squash --subject ... --body ...` → squash commit [`4f2217dc`](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/commit/4f2217dc1aa64d996a5fc67ac99d00db384aade2) on `main`. Full message verified — the `BREAKING CHANGE:` line survived intact at the very bottom of the squash body (the part python-semantic-release parses for footer detection).

**Semantic-release run:**

- Triggered automatically on push to `main`. Run [`26677937192`](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/actions/runs/26677937192) completed in 1m17s.
- Output: tag `ohtv-v0.17.0`, GitHub Release [ohtv-v0.17.0](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/releases/tag/ohtv-v0.17.0), CHANGELOG appended with `### Breaking Changes` entry.
- Release notes confirm the `### Breaking Changes` section contains the exact footer wording:

  > **gen**: Ohtv gen objs/titles/run multi-conv mode now excludes sub-conversations by default. Use --include-sub-conversations to restore the pre-v1.0.0 behavior.

- Minor bump (0.16.2 → 0.17.0) rather than major bump confirms `major_on_zero = false` in `pyproject.toml` is doing its job, exactly as the round-1 review worker predicted.

**State after merge:**

- PR #154: merged, closed.
- Issue #125: closed via `Fixes #125` in squash body.
- Open PRs: 0.
- Ready+priority:medium queue: #127, #128 (both root-grain cluster siblings of #125 — same cluster context as the v0.16.1/v0.16.2/v0.17.0 trio).

**Cluster progress (`#122` root-grain rollout):**

| Issue | PR | Status | Release |
|---|---|---|---|
| #123 weekly-counts | #150 | merged | v0.16.1 |
| #124 velocity | #153 | merged | v0.16.2 |
| **#125 gen objs/titles/run** | **#154** | **merged** | **v0.17.0 (this entry)** |
| #126 classification policy | — | open | — |
| #127 list/refs display roll-up | — | open | — |
| #128 RAG citation dedup | — | open | — |

Next root-grain issue is #127 — orchestrator's late-addendum prediction stands.

### 2026-05-30 07:50 UTC - Orchestrator

**Active Workers:**
| Conv ID | Type | Working On | Status |
|---------|------|------------|--------|
| `18f797e` | implementation | Issue #127 — `list`/`refs` root-grain | **NEW** running |

**Spawned: Implementation Worker**
- Issue: [#127 — `ohtv list` and `refs` surface sub-conversations as siblings of their roots](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/issues/127) (`priority:medium`)
- Conversation: [`18f797e`](https://app.all-hands.dev/conversations/18f797e3fb7643a5b762237331c65ef5)
- Start task: `36bd613f` → READY in ~5s (first poll), sandbox RUNNING.

**Why implementation (decision-tree match):**

- **Step 1 — Human INSTRUCTION check**: 0 unacknowledged (`awk '/^```/{f=!f;next} !f && /^## INSTRUCTION:/{print}' WORKLOG.md` → empty).
- **Step 2/3 — Active workers**: API query `/app-conversations/search?selected_repository=jpshackelford/ohtv&limit=20` → only `0b9b6f9` (self) was `running`; merge worker `fc23665` (PR #154) had `execution_status=null` (finished — confirmed by 07:24Z entry pushing the v0.17.0 outcome to WORKLOG). Both slots free at wake-up.
- **Step 4 — Open PRs**: 0 (PR #154 merged 07:21Z as `4f2217d`; `ohtv-v0.17.0` released via [run `26677937192`](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/actions/runs/26677937192) at 07:23Z with the `⚠ BREAKING CHANGES` CHANGELOG entry — confirmed by the previous orchestrator's late addendum and the merge worker's own entry).
- **Step 4 — Issue census**:
  - Issues needing expansion: **0**.
  - Ready, prioritized: #127 (`priority:medium`), #128 (`priority:medium`).
  - Ready, unprioritized: #145, #148, #149.
- **Decision-tree walk** (PR slot, no open PR branch):
  - "No open PR + ready issues with priority" → ✅ MATCH.
  - Tie-break between #127 and #128 (both `priority:medium`): by issue number → **#127**. Also matches the merge worker's hand-off prediction ("Next root-grain issue is #127") and the late addendum from the prior orchestrator.

**Critical context injected into the implementation worker's prompt:**

The worker brief carries forward the full root-grain cluster history because the pattern matters for cluster consistency:
- **Sibling pattern reference**: #123 (predicate in WHERE), #124 (DISTINCT-keyed-on-root), **#125 (flag-threaded, `--include-sub-conversations`, BREAKING)**. #127 is `--include-sub-conversations` again — the display surface follows #125's flag spelling exactly, not `--include-subs`.
- **BREAKING CHANGE semver call**: pre-emptively framed as Option A from #154's playbook. `[tool.semantic_release] major_on_zero = false` means the footer ships as **v0.18.0** with a `⚠ BREAKING CHANGES` CHANGELOG entry — NOT v1.0.0. The prompt explicitly instructs the worker to add a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer to the eventual squash-merge commit body (mirror #154's `11f35231` empty-commit pattern OR include it in the PR description's belt-and-suspenders Breaking Change Acknowledgment section).
- **Exact cut sites** from issue #127's expanded body: `cli.py` `_filter_by_pr` L1899, `_filter_by_repo` L2072, `_filter_by_action` L2106, `_filter_by_label` L2179; new helper `expand_to_roots` in `src/ohtv/filters.py`; `ConversationStore.list_by_date_range` gains `include_subs` kwarg; `ohtv refs <id>` rolls up subtree refs only when id is a root.
- **AC test matrix**: 5 scenarios (T-1 through T-5) explicitly listed in the issue — worker instructed to cover all five.
- **Migration-019 guardrail pattern**: PRAGMA check raises friendly `RuntimeError` at command invocation, not import time (matches #123/#124/#125/#126's idiom).

**Spawn payload shape** (validated):
- `selected_repository=jpshackelford/ohtv`, `git_provider=github`, no `selected_branch` (worker creates feature branch from main).
- `pr_number=[]` (new implementation, no existing PR).
- `plugins=[github:jpshackelford/.openhands plugins/ohtv-workflow @feat/ohtv-workflow-plugin]`.
- `initial_message.content[].type=text`, `run=true`.
- POST `/api/v1/app-conversations` with `X-Access-Token: $OPENHANDS_API_KEY` → start task `36bd613f` returned `status=WORKING`; first poll (5s later) → `READY`, `app_conversation_id=18f797e3…`; `/app-conversations?ids=18f797e3…` confirmed `execution_status=running`, `sandbox_status=RUNNING`.

**Worklog housekeeping (executed this cycle):**

- WORKLOG.md was **1645 lines** at wake-up (well past the 300-line truncation threshold the previous orchestrator flagged).
- This wake-up is the natural break-point the previous orchestrator predicted (post-v0.17.0 release, before the #127 impl spawn).
- Truncation ran the canonical algorithm from `/truncate-worklog` skill:
  - Parsed 28 total entries, 15 productive.
  - Newest productive entry: `2026-05-30 07:24:00+00:00` (merge worker outcome for PR #154 / v0.17.0).
  - Cutoff calculated as 6-hour productive span back → `2026-05-30 00:55:00+00:00` (the 00:55Z expansion worker for #148).
  - Kept 21 entries spanning the full PR #151 → PR #152 → PR #153 → PR #154 sequence (the complete root-grain cluster ship-off).
  - Archived 7 older entries to `WORKLOG_ARCHIVE_2026-05-29.md` (3 entries) and `WORKLOG_ARCHIVE_2026-05-30.md` (4 entries).
- WORKLOG.md is now ~1253 lines (still long because the kept productive entries are individually verbose, but the 6h span is intact and the dead-spawn diagnostic noise from 22:50Z–00:21Z is offloaded).

**Cluster progress snapshot** (post-v0.17.0):

| Issue | PR | Status | Release |
|---|---|---|---|
| #123 weekly-counts | #150 | merged | v0.16.1 |
| #124 velocity | #153 | merged | v0.16.2 |
| #125 gen objs/titles/run | #154 | merged | v0.17.0 ⚠ BREAKING |
| **#127 list/refs display** | — | **in implementation now** | (target: v0.18.0 ⚠ BREAKING) |
| #126 classification policy | — | open, queued | — |
| #128 RAG citation dedup | — | open, queued | — |

**Expansion slot:**

- `gh issue list --state open` filtered to `(ready or hold) | not` → empty. **No issues need expansion.** 30th consecutive idle expansion cycle, but PR slot productive this cycle → no auto-disable risk.

**Next cycle expectations (~08:20Z window):**

- Implementation worker `18f797e` turnaround: typical impl-worker cycle is 30-60 minutes for an issue of #127's size (3-4 module touches, ~5 ACs, regression test matrix). Could take longer if test infrastructure needs new fixtures for sub-conv scenarios.
- Most likely next-cycle state:
  - **Draft PR created, CI running** → wait (impl worker finishing up).
  - **Draft PR + CI green** → wait (impl worker about to flip to ready).
  - **Ready PR, no docs comment** → spawn **docs worker** (mirror #154's lifecycle).
- If `18f797e` is still `running` and no PR exists by 08:50Z, investigate per the "dead spawn" pattern from 2026-05-29 22:50Z–00:21Z (but the recent productive impl-worker cycles `5c05fff` for #125, `d3fcf92` for #124 indicate dispatch is healthy — no immediate cause for concern).

**Auto-disable counter:** **0 → 0.** Productive cycle (spawned implementation worker — terminal action that opens the #127 leg of the root-grain cluster). **Forty-fourth consecutive productive cycle.** Not at risk.

EXIT per orchestrate skill — one action per wake-up (the truncation was Step 0.5 housekeeping; the spawn is the dispatch action).

### 2026-05-30 08:20 UTC - Orchestrator

**Active Workers:**
| Conv ID | Type | Working On | Status |
|---------|------|------------|--------|
| `f7c21ca` | docs | PR #155 — `list`/`refs` README delta | **NEW** running |

**Spawned: Documentation Worker**
- PR: [#155 — feat(list,refs): roots-only by default with subtree rollup (#127)](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/pull/155)
- Conversation: [`f7c21ca`](https://app.all-hands.dev/conversations/f7c21cab4d25438f93a6a8b439d39a04)
- Start task: `9ff807e9` → READY in ~5s (first poll), sandbox RUNNING, agent `execution_status=running`.

**Why docs (decision-tree match):**

- **Step 1 — Human INSTRUCTION check**: 0 unacknowledged (`awk '/^```/{f=!f;next} !f && /^## INSTRUCTION:/{print}' WORKLOG.md` → empty).
- **Step 2/3 — Active workers**: API query for `selected_repository=jpshackelford/ohtv` → `5a19b24` is this orchestrator (running); `18f797e` (the #127 impl worker spawned at 07:50Z) is now **`execution_status=finished`** with sandbox RUNNING-but-released; `0b9b6f9` (prior orchestrator) is sandbox MISSING (terminated). Both worker slots free at wake-up.
- **Step 4 — Open PRs**: **1** — PR #155 opened at 08:06:47Z by the just-completed impl worker.
- **Step 4 — Issue census**: 0 issues need expansion; ready/prioritized: #127 (now in PR #155), #128. Ready/unprioritized: #145, #148, #149.
- **PR #155 state probe** (`gh pr view 155 --json …`):
  - `isDraft=false`, `state=OPEN`, `mergeable=MERGEABLE`, `reviewDecision=APPROVED`.
  - CI: `lint=SUCCESS`, `pytest=SUCCESS`, `pr-review=SUCCESS` (1 SKIPPED + 1 SUCCESS pr-review entries — the latter is the binding one).
  - `last_commit=2026-05-30T08:05:51Z`, `n_comments=0` (no docs comment, no test comment, no review threads).
  - Files changed (4): `src/ohtv/cli.py`, `src/ohtv/filters.py`, `tests/unit/test_cli_list_refs_subs.py`, `tests/unit/test_filters.py`. **README.md absent** — confirmed via `gh pr diff 155 --name-only`.
- **Decision-tree walk** (PR slot):
  - "PR exists, ready, CI green, **README not updated**" → ✅ MATCH.
  - Other branches eliminated: not draft (skip "still in impl"), 0 comments (skip review), no test comment (cannot skip ahead to merge, would violate "test what's documented" ordering principle).

**Critical context injected into the docs worker's prompt:**

The brief carries the full breaking-change framing because the docs delta is the user-facing migration surface for the v0.18.0 ship:

- **Two surfaces flipping**: `ohtv list` default and `ohtv refs` default both move from "show every row including subs" → "show roots only". New `--include-sub-conversations` flag (spelling matches PR #154 verbatim, NOT `--include-subs`) is the opt-out.
- **Single-conv `refs <root-id>` rollup** documented separately: when id IS a root, returns union of subtree refs (dedup by URL); when id IS a sub, falls through to existing single-conv path.
- **Filter resolution semantic change** (`--pr`, `--repo`, `--label`, `--action` now route through `expand_to_roots`): flagged as "worth a one-liner if existing doc text would mislead readers."
- **v0.18.0 ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES callout**: cluster pattern is now well-established (#125 / v0.17.0 introduced it for `gen objs/titles/run`). Worker instructed to mirror PR #154's README section as template.
- **AGENTS.md item #32 cross-reference**: explicitly told NOT to renumber; just add a sub-bullet noting #127 has shipped if the existing list mentions the predecessors.
- **Hard guardrails**: do NOT touch CHANGELOG.md (semantic-release owns it on merge); do NOT touch source/tests/pyproject.toml; do NOT flip PR back to draft (docs-only commit is safe on ready+approved+green PR); do NOT remove existing `BREAKING CHANGE:` marker.
- **Bug-discovery branch**: if worker spots an implementation bug while writing docs (e.g. flag spelling mismatch with #154, `--include-sub-conversations` broken on `refs`), they're instructed to flag-via-comment and EXIT without committing — so the next orchestrator cycle can spawn a review-round worker instead of merging a buggy default flip.
- **Commit message contract**: `docs:` subject (silently ignored by semantic-release per AGENTS.md commit contract table); the eventual squash-merge keeps `feat(list,refs)!` + `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer.
- **Marker comment for next worker**: explicit template provided — `## Documentation updated for PR #155` header so the next orchestrator can detect "docs done → spawn testing worker" via the regex in the decision tree.

**Spawn payload shape** (validated):
- `selected_repository=jpshackelford/ohtv`, `git_provider=github`, no `selected_branch` (worker `git checkout`s the PR branch itself).
- `pr_number=[155]` so the worker has PR context out of the box.
- `plugins=[github:jpshackelford/.openhands plugins/ohtv-workflow @feat/ohtv-workflow-plugin]`.
- `initial_message.content[].type=text`, `run=true`.
- POST `/api/v1/app-conversations` with `X-Session-API-Key: $OPENHANDS_API_KEY` → start task `9ff807e9` returned `status=WORKING`; first 5s poll → `READY`, `app_conversation_id=f7c21cab…`; `/app-conversations?ids=f7c21cab…` confirmed `execution_status=running`, `sandbox_status=RUNNING`.

**Worklog housekeeping (deferred this cycle):**

- WORKLOG.md was ~1382 lines at wake-up (slightly above the 300-line threshold but the 07:50Z orchestrator already executed a truncation in the previous cycle — bringing it from 1645 down to ~1253 lines and archiving 7 older entries to `WORKLOG_ARCHIVE_2026-05-29.md` / `WORKLOG_ARCHIVE_2026-05-30.md`).
- Deferring another truncation to keep "one action per wake-up" discipline — the spawn IS this cycle's action, and the prior cycle's truncation kept the productive 6-hour window intact. Next truncation opportunity: after the testing worker posts results (expected next cycle).

**Cluster progress snapshot** (post-impl, pre-docs):

| Issue | PR | Status | Release |
|---|---|---|---|
| #123 weekly-counts | #150 | merged | v0.16.1 |
| #124 velocity | #153 | merged | v0.16.2 |
| #125 gen objs/titles/run | #154 | merged | v0.17.0 ⚠ BREAKING |
| **#127 list/refs display** | **#155** | **docs round in progress** | (target: v0.18.0 ⚠ BREAKING) |
| #126 classification policy | — | open, queued | — |
| #128 RAG citation dedup | — | open, queued | — |

**Expansion slot:**

- `gh issue list --state open` filtered to `(ready or hold) | not` → empty. **No issues need expansion.** 31st consecutive idle expansion cycle, but PR slot productive this cycle → no auto-disable risk.

**Next cycle expectations (~08:50Z window):**

- Docs worker `f7c21ca` turnaround: docs-only commits typically complete in 10-25 minutes. Worker needs to (1) `git checkout` PR branch, (2) read diffs for context, (3) write README delta + AGENTS.md sub-bullet, (4) push & wait for CI (lint+pytest run on docs commits too — should stay green), (5) post the marker comment.
- Most likely next-cycle state:
  - **Docs commit pushed, CI green, marker comment posted** → spawn **testing worker** per "test what's documented" principle.
  - **Docs commit pushed but CI failing** → wait one cycle (docs commits shouldn't break CI, but lint can if README has CI-checked formatting like the `make lint` step would catch).
  - **No docs commit yet** → wait (worker may still be reading the PR #154 sibling delta for tone).
  - **Worker flagged an implementation bug via comment** → spawn **review worker** instead of testing worker (the prompt's bug-discovery branch).
- If `f7c21ca` is still `running` with no commits by 09:20Z, investigate per the "dead spawn" pattern from 2026-05-29 22:50Z–00:21Z. Recent docs-worker spawns (PR #154 lifecycle) have all been healthy ~15-min cycles, so this is precautionary only.

**Auto-disable counter:** **0 → 0.** Productive cycle (spawned docs worker — terminal action advancing PR #155 through the lifecycle). **Forty-fifth consecutive productive cycle.** Not at risk.

EXIT per orchestrate skill — one action per wake-up.

  - Earlier branches eliminated: not draft, docs comment present (skip docs worker), no test comment yet (cannot skip to review or merge — "test what's documented" gate enforces ordering).

**Critical context injected into the testing worker's prompt:**

The brief mirrors the structure of the PR #154 / v0.17.0 testing-worker brief (now well-established) with #127-specific test matrix:

- **AC matrix T-1 → T-5** (lifted verbatim from issue #127's expanded body): list roots-only default; `--include-sub-conversations` opt-out; refs multi-conv roots-only; refs `<root-id>` subtree rollup (union, dedup by URL); refs `<sub-id>` fall-through to single-conv path.
- **Filter-routing scenario**: `ohtv list --pr <num>` and `--repo <name>` must return ONLY roots, even when subs contribute to the same PR/repo. This is the new `expand_to_roots` call site routed from `_filter_by_pr`/`_filter_by_repo`/`_filter_by_action`/`_filter_by_label` in `cli.py`.
- **README example verification**: worker explicitly instructed to copy the new README examples from the PR diff and execute them verbatim, flagging any drift. This is the "test what's documented" principle in action.
- **Unit-test sanity check**: `pytest tests/unit/test_cli_list_refs_subs.py tests/unit/test_filters.py -v` on the fresh checkout (beyond what CI already validated).
- **Edge cases**: `--no-refs` compatibility, `-A` + new flag combination, missing-id error path, root with zero subs.
- **Bug-discovery exit branch**: worker instructed NOT to commit fixes; if a bug is found, flag in the test report and EXIT — next orchestrator cycle will spawn a review-round worker.
- **Hard guardrails**: read-only pass (no commits, no PR state changes), `@openhands-ai` authorship footer, single PR comment using the `## Manual Test Results — PR #155` header (so the next orchestrator's regex finds it cleanly).

**Spawn payload shape** (validated):
- `selected_repository=jpshackelford/ohtv`, `git_provider=github`, no `selected_branch` (worker `gh pr checkout 155`s the branch itself).
- `pr_number=[155]` so the worker has PR context.
- `plugins=[github:jpshackelford/.openhands plugins/ohtv-workflow @feat/ohtv-workflow-plugin]`.
- `initial_message.content[].type=text`, `run=true`.
- POST `/api/v1/app-conversations` with `X-Session-API-Key: $OPENHANDS_API_KEY` → start task `d722427b` returned `status=WORKING`; first 6s poll → `READY`, `app_conversation_id=e7f42f8f…`; `/app-conversations?ids=e7f42f8f…` confirmed `execution_status=running`, `sandbox_status=RUNNING`.

**Worklog housekeeping (deferred this cycle):**

- WORKLOG.md was 1468 lines at wake-up (07:50Z orchestrator truncated 1645→1253; 08:20Z deferred; this cycle's spawn entry pushes back up).
- Still inside the productive 6-hour window — every kept entry is part of the active PR #155 lifecycle (impl 07:50Z → docs 08:20Z → testing 08:50Z, all converging on the v0.18.0 ship).
- Natural truncation point is **post-merge** (or post-review-round resolution) when the cluster-progress snapshot crystallizes. Deferring again to keep "one action per wake-up" discipline.

**Cluster progress snapshot** (post-docs, pre-test):

| Issue | PR | Status | Release |
|---|---|---|---|
| #123 weekly-counts | #150 | merged | v0.16.1 |
| #124 velocity | #153 | merged | v0.16.2 |
| #125 gen objs/titles/run | #154 | merged | v0.17.0 ⚠ BREAKING |
| **#127 list/refs display** | **#155** | **testing round in progress** | (target: v0.18.0 ⚠ BREAKING) |
| #126 classification policy | — | open, queued | — |
| #128 RAG citation dedup | — | open, queued | — |

**Expansion slot:**

- `gh issue list --state open` filtered to `(ready or hold) | not` → empty. **No issues need expansion.** 32nd consecutive idle expansion cycle, but PR slot productive this cycle → no auto-disable risk.

**Next cycle expectations (~09:20Z window):**

- Testing worker `e7f42f8` turnaround: testing cycles for a CLI display surface typically run 15-30 minutes (env setup + `ohtv sync` + matrix execution + report write-up). Plus this PR's matrix is broad (T-1 through T-5 + filter routing + README examples + edge cases), so could trend longer.
- Most likely next-cycle state:
  - **`## Manual Test Results — PR #155` comment posted, all green** → spawn **merge worker** (sibling pattern: PR #154's `fc23665b` merge worker took the v0.17.0 BREAKING ship to completion in one cycle).
  - **Test report posted, issues found** → spawn **review-round worker** to address the regressions before merge.
  - **No test comment yet, worker still `running`** → wait (testing typically takes 15-30 min; this would only be a concern past 09:50Z).
  - **Worker `finished` but no comment posted** → investigate per the "dead spawn" pattern from 2026-05-29 22:50Z–00:21Z.
- The eventual merge worker brief should mirror PR #154's: conventional commit subject `feat(list,refs)!: roots-only by default with subtree rollup` + `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer in body, squash-merge, semantic-release picks up the `!` → v0.18.0 + `⚠ BREAKING CHANGES` CHANGELOG section.

**Auto-disable counter:** **0 → 0.** Productive cycle (spawned testing worker — terminal action advancing PR #155 through the lifecycle). **Forty-sixth consecutive productive cycle.** Not at risk.

EXIT per orchestrate skill — one action per wake-up.

### 2026-05-30 09:52 UTC - Orchestrator

**Active Workers:**
| Conv ID | Type | Working On | Status |
|---------|------|------------|--------|
| `8723ef4` | testing (retry) | PR #155 — manual test pass (attempt 2/2) | **NEW** running |

**Spawned: Manual Testing Worker (retry after dead-spawn)**
- PR: [#155 — feat(list,refs): roots-only by default with subtree rollup (#127)](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/pull/155)
- Conversation: [`8723ef4`](https://app.all-hands.dev/conversations/8723ef46862c482f9913876bb6c8003a)
- Start task `11e3af85` → READY in ~5s (first poll), sandbox RUNNING, agent `execution_status=running`.

**Why testing-RETRY (dead-spawn investigation):**

- **Step 1 — Human INSTRUCTION check**: 0 unacknowledged.
- **Step 2/3 — Active workers**: API query `selected_repository=jpshackelford/ohtv&limit=10` → only this orchestrator (`c4b122f`) is `running`. Testing worker `e7f42f8` (spawned 08:50Z) is now `execution_status=null`, `sandbox=PAUSED` — finished and released.
- **Step 4 — Open PRs**: 1 — PR #155 (`oAFc green ready`, approved, mergeable=UNKNOWN, last commit 08:24:09Z = docs round commit).
- **Step 4 — Issue census**: 0 issues need expansion; ready/prioritized: #127 (in PR #155), #128. Ready/unprioritized: #145, #148, #149.

**Dead-spawn diagnosis for `e7f42f8`:**

Full conv-detail API probe shows the worker DID consume real LLM work:
- `accumulated_cost = $3.20`, `prompt_tokens = 2,681,506`, `completion_tokens = 4,177`, `cache_read_tokens = 2,376,483`, `cache_write_tokens = 304,136`
- `created_at = 08:49:32Z`, `updated_at = 09:21:57Z` → ~32 minutes wall time, then sandbox released
- `llm_model = litellm_proxy/claude-opus-4-7`
- `execution_status = null`, `agent_state = null`, `last_active_at = null` — fields cleared after agent stopped

But **`gh pr view 155 --comments` returned only one comment** — the 08:25Z `## Documentation updated for PR #155` marker from the f7c21cab docs worker. **No `## Manual Test Results` comment exists.**

This is the same failure mode flagged in the prior orchestrator's "next cycle expectations" — _"Worker `finished` but no comment posted → investigate per the 'dead spawn' pattern from 2026-05-29 22:50Z–00:21Z."_ The 32-min runtime + $3.20 burn + 4K completion tokens suggests the worker exercised the test matrix but ran out of turns / hit an internal stop condition before the final `gh pr comment` call. The prior prompt may have over-emphasized investigation depth without making the final comment unambiguously the last action.

**Mitigations in the retry prompt (`8723ef4`):**

The replacement prompt is restructured around a single cardinal rule, repeated at the top, in the middle, and at the bottom:

> **EVERY EXIT PATH MUST END WITH A POSTED PR COMMENT.** If you are about to stop working — for ANY reason (success, partial pass, env-setup failure, ran out of turns, found a bug) — your LAST tool call before stopping MUST be a `gh pr comment 155` call.

Specific concessions made vs. the 08:50Z prompt to reduce turn pressure:

- **Setup budget**: hard 10-min cap on troubleshooting; partial report if blocked.
- **Test matrix**: shrunk to 8 named tests (T-1 … T-8), each capturing ~20 lines of output. No "edge case sweep", no "all combinations of flags".
- **Report template**: fixed table format with PASS/FAIL/partial cells — fast to fill in, no prose required.
- **Exit-path emphasis**: explicit instruction that "post a short report saying 'setup failed at step X'" is preferred over "post nothing".
- **No bug fixes**: bug-discovery branch still says EXIT without committing — but now framed as "document in report and stop" rather than "investigate further".
- **Read-only / guardrails**: identical to prior prompt (no commits, no PR state changes, no WORKLOG.md edits).

**Spawn payload shape** (validated):
- `selected_repository=jpshackelford/ohtv`, `git_provider=github`, no `selected_branch` (worker `gh pr checkout 155`s).
- `pr_number=[155]` for PR context.
- `plugins=[github:jpshackelford/.openhands plugins/ohtv-workflow @feat/ohtv-workflow-plugin]`.
- `initial_message.content[].type=text`, `run=true`.
- POST `/api/v1/app-conversations` with `X-Session-API-Key: $OPENHANDS_API_KEY` → start task `11e3af85` returned `status=WORKING`; first 5s poll → `READY`, `app_conversation_id=8723ef46…`; `/app-conversations?ids=8723ef46…` confirmed `execution_status=running`, `sandbox_status=RUNNING`.

**Worklog housekeeping (deferred this cycle):**

- WORKLOG.md was 1554 lines at wake-up. The 07:50Z orchestrator already truncated from 1645 → 1253 lines; subsequent productive entries (08:20Z spawn, 08:50Z spawn, plus this entry) have grown it back. Still inside the productive 6-hour PR #155 lifecycle window — every kept entry is part of the active push to v0.18.0.
- Natural truncation point is **post-merge** when the cluster-progress snapshot crystallizes (or post-second-dead-spawn if this retry also fails, which would justify a deeper investigation entry). Deferring again to keep "one action per wake-up" discipline.

**Cluster progress snapshot** (post-docs, second testing attempt in flight):

| Issue | PR | Status | Release |
|---|---|---|---|
| #123 weekly-counts | #150 | merged | v0.16.1 |
| #124 velocity | #153 | merged | v0.16.2 |

| **#127 list/refs display** | **#155** | **testing round 2/2 in progress** | (target: v0.18.0 ⚠ BREAKING) |
| #126 classification policy | — | open, queued | — |
| #128 RAG citation dedup | — | open, queued | — |

**Expansion slot:**

- `gh issue list --state open` filtered to `(ready or hold) | not` → empty. **No issues need expansion.** 33rd consecutive idle expansion cycle, but PR slot productive this cycle → no auto-disable risk.

**Next cycle expectations (~10:20Z window):**

- Testing worker `8723ef4` turnaround: with the tightened prompt and 8-test matrix, expecting 20-40 min wall time. Setup window is ~5-10 min, matrix execution ~10-20 min, report compose + post ~5 min.
- Most likely next-cycle state:
  - **`## Manual Test Results — PR #155` comment posted, recommendation=ready-to-merge** → spawn **merge worker** (sibling pattern: PR #154's `fc23665b` merge worker took the v0.17.0 BREAKING ship to completion in one cycle).
  - **Test report posted, recommendation=needs-review-round** → spawn **review-round worker** to address regressions.
  - **Test report posted, recommendation=blocked (env setup failure)** → orchestrator investigates the blocker; may need a human escalation if the sandbox env is degraded.
  - **No comment yet, worker still `running`** → wait (still inside 20-40 min budget).
  - **Worker `finished` AGAIN with no comment** → 2nd dead spawn; escalate to a `## INSTRUCTION:` block in WORKLOG asking @jpshackelford to weigh in before burning another $3+. Possible patterns: the worker's prompt is genuinely getting truncated by an LLM-side limit, the `gh pr comment` tool is failing silently, or the agent is hitting a turn-budget cap that the orchestrator can't see from outside.
- The eventual merge worker brief should mirror PR #154's: conventional commit subject `feat(list,refs)!: roots-only by default with subtree rollup` + `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer in body, squash-merge, semantic-release picks up the `!` → v0.18.0 + `⚠ BREAKING CHANGES` CHANGELOG section.

**Auto-disable counter:** **0 → 0.** Productive cycle (spawned retry testing worker — terminal action advancing PR #155 through the lifecycle). **Forty-seventh consecutive productive cycle.** Not at risk.

EXIT per orchestrate skill — one action per wake-up.

### 2026-05-30 10:20 UTC - Orchestrator

**Active Workers (at cycle exit):**
| Conv ID | Type | Working On | Status |
|---------|------|------------|--------|
| `f4efb86` | merge | PR #155 → squash-merge as v0.18.0 ⚠ BREAKING | **NEW** running |

**Spawned: Merge Worker for PR #155**
- PR: [#155 — feat(list,refs): roots-only by default with subtree rollup (#127)](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/pull/155)
- Conversation: [`f4efb86`](https://app.all-hands.dev/conversations/f4efb861777c4726a8cdeb82ef018440)
- Start task `23a33c5f` → READY in ~10s; agent `execution_status=running`, sandbox `RUNNING`.

**Why merge (decision-tree walk):**

- **Step 1 — Human INSTRUCTION check**: 0 unacknowledged.
- **Step 2/3 — Active workers**: Testing retry worker `8723ef4` is `execution_status=finished`, sandbox=RUNNING (about to release), `updated_at=10:09:21Z`. **No active workers.**
- **Step 4 — Open PRs**: 1 — PR #155.
  - `state=OPEN`, `isDraft=false`, `mergeable=MERGEABLE`, `reviewDecision=APPROVED`.
  - CI: `lint pass 5s`, `pytest pass 53s`. Both green.
  - Last commit: `2026-05-30T08:24:09Z` (docs commit `711d7f7`).
  - Comments: 2 total — docs marker (08:25:42Z) + Manual Test Results (10:09:20Z, **AFTER** last commit, so test is current).
  - Review threads: 0 unresolved (GraphQL `reviewThreads` empty).
- **Step 4b — Test report content**: retry worker `8723ef4` posted comprehensive 8-test matrix (T-1 … T-8), all PASS except T-5 marked `⚠️ partial (not bug)` — degenerate test case because the account has no true delegated subs in the sync window; rollup branch was instead exercised through dashed-id duplicate rows from item #14, which the code handles correctly. Recommendation: **ready-to-merge**.
- **Step 5 — Open issues**: 5 ready (all expanded). 0 need expansion. Priority order: #128 (medium, queued for impl after #155 merges), #127 (medium, IN PR #155). Unprioritized ready: #145, #148, #149.

**Decision-tree path**: `PR exists, ready, CI green, test results valid (timestamp > last commit), good rating (ready-to-merge), docs valid (08:25Z marker exists)` → **Spawn merge worker**. No re-test trigger (no significant code changes after the test; the 711d7f7 docs commit predates the test).

**Dead-spawn risk mitigation**:

The prior testing worker `e7f42f8` (08:50Z spawn) was a dead spawn — finished after $3.20 burn with no comment posted. The retry `8723ef4` (09:52Z spawn) succeeded thanks to the tightened prompt with cardinal "EVERY EXIT PATH MUST END WITH A POSTED PR COMMENT" rule. The merge worker prompt is short and unambiguous (single terminal action — `gh pr merge --squash`), so dead-spawn risk is low. The cluster's PR #154 merge (`fc23665b`) used the same shape and completed in one cycle.

**Squash-commit guidance baked into the prompt**:

- Subject: `feat(list,refs): roots-only by default with subtree rollup (#127)` — matches PR title (no `!`).
- Body: implementation summary + AC coverage + test summary.
- Footer: **MUST** include `BREAKING CHANGE:` explaining the user-facing default flip (list/refs no longer include sub-conversations by default; pass `--include-sub-conversations` to restore).
- Per AGENTS.md release contract + `[tool.semantic_release] major_on_zero = false`, the footer triggers v0.17.0 → **v0.18.0** with `⚠ BREAKING CHANGES` CHANGELOG section. Mirrors PR #154 → v0.17.0 precedent for #125.

**Cluster progress snapshot** (merge-in-flight):

| Issue | PR | Status | Release |
|---|---|---|---|
| #123 weekly-counts | #150 | merged | v0.16.1 |
| #124 velocity | #153 | merged | v0.16.2 |
| #125 gen objs/titles/run | #154 | merged | v0.17.0 ⚠ BREAKING |
| **#127 list/refs display** | **#155** | **merge in progress** | **(target: v0.18.0 ⚠ BREAKING)** |
| #126 classification policy | — | open, queued | — |
| #128 RAG citation dedup | — | open, queued | — |

After this merge, the #122 root-grain cluster has only #128 (RAG citation dedup, ready/priority:medium) remaining on the display surface. #126 is the policy companion.

**Expansion slot:**

- `gh issue list --state open` filtered to `(ready or hold) | not` → empty. **No issues need expansion.** Thirty-fourth consecutive idle expansion cycle, but the PR slot is productive this cycle → no auto-disable risk.

**Next cycle expectations (~10:50Z window):**

- Merge worker `f4efb86` turnaround: PR #154 precedent was ~10 min from spawn to merge + semantic-release tag. Expecting similar.
- Most likely next-cycle state:
  - **PR #155 merged, `chore(release): ohtv 0.18.0 [skip ci]` commit on main, `ohtv-v0.18.0` tag + GitHub Release created** → spawn **implementation worker for #128** (next prioritized ready issue, RAG citation dedup — final cluster member).
  - **PR #155 merged but no release commit yet** → likely a semantic-release race; check the `release.yml` workflow run; if stuck, escalate.
  - **PR #155 merge failed** (rare: mergeable=UNKNOWN flipped) → orchestrator investigates; possibly re-run CI or rebase.
  - **Merge worker still running** → wait one more cycle.

**Worklog housekeeping:**

WORKLOG.md is at 1645 lines (was truncated at 07:50Z down to 1253; productive cluster activity has grown it back). Will defer truncation to **post-#155 merge** when the cluster snapshot crystallizes — that's the natural archive point. The forty-eighth consecutive productive cycle is a higher priority than the housekeeping pass right now.

**Auto-disable counter:** **0 → 0.** Productive cycle (spawned merge worker — terminal action that ships v0.18.0 and closes the PR #155 / Issue #127 leg of the root-grain cluster). **Forty-eighth consecutive productive cycle.** Not at risk.

EXIT per orchestrate skill — one action per wake-up.

### 2026-05-30 10:48 UTC - Orchestrator

**Active Workers (at cycle exit):**
| Conv ID | Type | Working On | Status |
|---------|------|------------|--------|
| `517c1b1` | implementation | Issue #128 — RAG `ask`/`search` cite root_conversation_id | **NEW** running |

**Spawned: Implementation Worker for Issue #128**
- Issue: [#128 — RAG `ask` and `search` cite sub-conversation IDs the user doesn't recognize](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/issues/128) (`priority:medium`)
- Conversation: [`517c1b1`](https://app.all-hands.dev/conversations/517c1b1b95c64dc0bc20c7fdd2082b5b)
- Start task `bc38306f` → `READY` after ~15s (2 `STARTING_CONVERSATION` polls); sandbox `RUNNING`, agent `execution_status=running`.

**Why impl for #128 (decision-tree walk):**

- **Step 1 — Human INSTRUCTION check**: 0 unacknowledged (`grep -A8 "## INSTRUCTION:" WORKLOG.md` → only the `0 unacknowledged` markers from prior cycle entries).
- **Step 2/3 — Active workers**: Only `368701a` (this orchestrator, `trigger=automation`) was `running` at entry. Prior merge worker `f4efb86` for PR #155 = `execution_status=finished` at 10:25:05Z (handed off the cluster-snapshot WORKLOG entry to `267fab2` on main). All other recent worker conv IDs (`c111e1d` 10:16Z orchestrator, `8723ef4` testing retry, `c4b122f`, `e7f42f8`, `7aab96f`, `f7c21ca`, `5a19b24`, `18f797e`) = `PAUSED`/`MISSING` with `execution_status=null`. **PR slot CLEAR; expansion slot CLEAR at cycle entry.**
- **Step 4 — Open PRs**: 0. PR #155 merged at 10:21:53Z, `5c0adfb` on main; semantic-release shipped `ohtv-v0.18.0` at 10:23:52Z (tag + Release).
- **Step 4 — Issue census**:
  - Needs expansion (no `ready`, no `hold`): **0** — expansion slot stays IDLE. **Thirty-fifth consecutive idle expansion cycle.** Not at auto-disable risk because PR slot productive this cycle.
  - Ready + prioritized: **#128** (`priority:medium`, RAG citation dedup).
  - Ready + unprioritized: #145, #148, #149.
  - On hold: #26, #90.
- **Decision-tree row matched**: *"No open PR + ready issues with priority → Spawn impl worker for highest priority ready issue."* Only one prioritized ready issue exists (#128), so no tie-break needed.

**Why #128 now (cluster context):**

#128 is the **final member** of the #122 root-conversation-aggregation cluster on the user-visible display surface. Cluster status after the v0.18.0 ship:

| Issue | PR | Status | Release |
|---|---|---|---|
| #122 (umbrella) | #138 | merged | (foundation) |
| #123 weekly-counts | #150 | merged | v0.16.1 |
| #124 velocity | #153 | merged | v0.16.2 |
| #125 gen objs/titles/run | #154 | merged | v0.17.0 ⚠ BREAKING |
| #127 list/refs display | #155 | merged | v0.18.0 ⚠ BREAKING |
| **#128 RAG ask/search cite** | **(impl-in-flight)** | **`517c1b1` working** | **(target: v0.18.1 — NO BREAKING)** |
| #126 classification policy | — | open, queued for impl after #128 | — |

#128 ships as a **non-breaking** patch release because, per the issue body, it is "**purely a display/dedup concern**" — the retrieval contract, the `embeddings` table, the `min_score`/`max_chunks` semantics, and the CLI surface are all unchanged. No `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer → semantic-release will tag `ohtv-v0.18.1`, not 0.19.0.

**Impl worker brief — three hard mitigations baked in:**

1. **Migration-number correction (RED text at the top of the prompt)**: The issue body cites *"migration 019"* for `root_conversation_id`. **The actual migration is 020** (per AGENTS.md item #32; PRs #152 and #155 already corrected this in their guard error messages — pattern is established). The prompt explicitly says: "every guard message, comment, docstring, and PR description that mentions the column's migration must say **020**, not 019." Mirrors the same mistake-prevention shape used in the #123 impl spawn brief.
2. **Render-layer-only constraint repeated 3×** in the prompt body + a "Hard constraints — DO NOT violate" section at the bottom: NO modifications to `embedding_store.search` / `search_conversations` / `get_context_for_rag`. The `JOIN ON e.conversation_id = c.id` is explicitly not modified. This is the issue's closing-checkbox AC, and the easiest way for an impl worker to over-reach.
3. **No `--include-sub-conversations` flag** — unlike sibling #125 (which legitimately has this flag), #128 explicitly rejects it (the bug is "users don't recognize sub IDs"; there's no opt-out value). The prompt cites the exact issue-body section that rejects it ("Section 'No new `--include-sub-conversations` flag'") so the worker doesn't re-derive and re-litigate the decision.

**`map_to_roots` helper placement decision** in the spawn brief: PR #155 (issue #127) shipped `expand_to_roots(conn, set)` in `src/ohtv/filters.py` per the issue's "Soft-related to #127" dependency note. The brief tells the worker to add a list-shaped companion `map_to_roots(conn, ids: list[str]) -> dict[str, str]` in the same `filters.py` module (not duplicated in rag.py), with the dict shape preserving rank order via caller-side lookup.

**Investigator-mode footnote**: The brief reminds the worker that the issue's "Out of Scope" section notes investigator mode (`--agent`) inherits the dedup for free via `RAGAnswer.context_chunks` — no per-investigator changes needed. Worth calling out in the PR description so reviewers don't ask.

**Spawn payload shape** (validated):
- `selected_repository=jpshackelford/ohtv`, `git_provider=github`, no `selected_branch` (worker creates its own `feat/rag-citation-root-dedup-128` from `origin/main`).
- `issue_number=[128]` for issue context.
- `plugins=[github:jpshackelford/.openhands plugins/ohtv-workflow @feat/ohtv-workflow-plugin]`.
- `initial_message.content[].type=text`, `run=true`. Prompt body = 12,104 chars; total payload = 12,823 bytes.
- POST `/api/v1/app-conversations` with `X-Session-API-Key: $OPENHANDS_API_KEY` → start task `bc38306f` returned `status=WORKING`; 3rd poll (15s in) → `READY`, `app_conversation_id=517c1b1b…`; `/app-conversations?ids=517c1b1b…` confirmed `execution_status=running`, `sandbox_status=RUNNING`.

**Sync notes:**
- Container respawned this cycle. `pip install --user git+...lxa.git git+...ohtv.git` succeeded (the `uv pip install --system` path still trips on read-only `/usr/local/lib/python3.13/site-packages`; the `pip install --user` fallback into `$HOME/.local/bin` works fine — recording again for next respawn).
- `lxa repo add jpshackelford/ohtv` was called (no-op after the existing board registration, but the underlying response now creates a default "Unnamed Board 1" — cosmetic, not breaking).
- `gh auth status` initially failed because `GH_TOKEN` env var was empty but the lowercase `github_token` was populated — used `export GH_TOKEN="$github_token"` to bridge. Same pattern as some prior respawns; the canonical fix would be to set GH_TOKEN at the cron-config level.
- `git pull origin main` → `Already up to date` (267fab2, post-#155 merge).

**Worklog housekeeping:**
- WORKLOG.md was 1753 lines at wake-up. Ran the 6-hour productive-window truncation algorithm in dry-run mode → returns "Nothing to archive — all productive entries within retention window." The four productive entries on the file all sit within the active push-to-merge cycle for PR #155 (08:20Z docs spawn → 08:50Z testing spawn → 10:20Z merge spawn → 10:25Z merge completion); none has aged past the 6-hour productive window measured from the most recent productive entry (10:25Z). Natural truncation point is **one cycle from now**, after the next impl-worker spawn or completion makes 10:25Z fall out of the productive window. Deferring per the discipline of one orchestrator action per wake-up.

**Cluster progress snapshot** (post-v0.18.0, impl-in-flight on final cluster member):

| Issue | PR | Status | Release |
|---|---|---|---|
| #123 weekly-counts | #150 | merged | v0.16.1 |
| #124 velocity | #153 | merged | v0.16.2 |
| #125 gen objs/titles/run | #154 | merged | v0.17.0 ⚠ BREAKING |
| #127 list/refs display | #155 | merged | v0.18.0 ⚠ BREAKING |
| **#128 RAG citation dedup** | **(impl `517c1b1`)** | **in flight** | **(target: v0.18.1)** |
| #126 classification policy | — | open, queued (next impl pick after #128 lands) | — |

After #128 lands, the only ready/prioritized issue remaining is #126 (classify policy); after that, the unprioritized backlog (#145, #148, #149) needs `/assess-priority` to graduate.

**Expansion slot (next-cycle outlook):**
- Backlog is 4 deep on `ready` (#126, #145, #148, #149). 0 issues need expansion. Slot stays IDLE — **34th + 1 = 35th consecutive idle expansion cycle**.
- Auto-disable risk: **NONE this cycle** because the PR slot is productive (impl spawn is a terminal action advancing PR #128's lifecycle). The orchestrator's quiet-cycle counter resets every productive cycle, so 35 idle-expansion-only cycles do not approach the auto-disable threshold.

**Next cycle expectations (~11:20Z window):**
- Impl worker `517c1b1` turnaround for #128: render-layer dedup is a focused cut (rag.py + cli.py + a one-shot helper in filters.py + ~6 test files). Sibling #155 (issue #127) took ~5 hours from impl-spawn to merge across multiple cycles (impl → docs → testing → merge); #128 is a simpler scope (no `selected_branch` config plumbing, no SELECT-layer dedup, no filter-reduce-layer dedup). Expected impl-only wall time: **45–90 min**. PR open + draft-to-ready transition expected by ~12:20Z.
- Most likely next-cycle state:
  - **PR open, draft, CI running** → wait (impl worker still finishing CI).
  - **PR open, draft, CI green** → wait one more cycle (impl worker may still be moving to ready).
  - **PR open, ready, CI green, no docs comment** → docs check: this is a render-layer-only patch. Per orchestrate skill *"Do NOT require docs update if only: Bug fixes that don't change documented behavior"* — `ohtv ask` and `ohtv search` keep the same flag surface, same output schema (just with deduped IDs). Docs SKIPPED → straight to testing. Same shape as #152, #153, #154 skipped docs.
  - **PR open, ready, CI green, no test results** → spawn testing worker.
  - **Worker `finished` but no PR opened** → 2nd cluster dead-spawn since PR #155's 08:50Z testing dead-spawn (`e7f42f8`); investigate per the same pattern, but for an impl worker this is unusual.

**Auto-disable counter:** **0 → 0.** Productive cycle (spawned impl worker for #128 — terminal action initiating the final cluster member). **Forty-ninth consecutive productive cycle.** Not at risk.

EXIT per orchestrate skill — one action per wake-up.
