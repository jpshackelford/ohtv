### 2026-06-04 22:52 UTC - Orchestrator

**Active Workers:**

| Conv ID | Type | Working On | Status |
|---------|------|------------|--------|
| `05df98c` | docs | PR #183 — README for `ohtv messages` command | **NEW** (running, verified) |

**Step 0 — Setup:** Workspace had no pre-existing `.venv`. `uv venv .venv` + `uv pip install git+…/lxa.git git+…/ohtv.git` succeeded into the project-local venv (system-wide `--system` install still blocked by `/usr/local/lib/python3.13/site-packages` perms — known, 11th cycle of project-local pattern). `lxa repo add jpshackelford/ohtv` succeeded into a new `Unnamed Board 1` (sandbox is fresh per cycle; lxa state does not persist). `ohtv sync --since 4h` skipped (the `--quiet` invocation hung beyond the soft timeout; all orchestrator-level decisions are made via `gh` + the direct OH API anyway).

**Step 0.5 — Housekeeping:** WORKLOG.md at **2588 lines** on entry. **12th consecutive cycle** truncation is overdue. Same standing recommendation: human `## INSTRUCTION: archive WORKLOG.md entries older than 10h` would unblock ~1500 lines in one commit, or a `/truncate-worklog` matcher fix to handle the reverse-chronological layout (new entries are now prepended after the `## Log` header, not appended at EOF — the existing matcher's 6h-productive-window logic doesn't account for this). **Deferring again** — PR slot has actionable work this cycle.

**Step 1 — Human Instructions:** None. `grep "^## INSTRUCTION:" WORKLOG.md` → all matches are inside fenced code blocks in orchestrator commentary; no unacknowledged human entries.

**Step 2 — Active Workers (pre-this-spawn):** Polled `app-conversations/search?limit=30` filtered to `execution_status=running OR sandbox_status=RUNNING`:

- `cf011a0` — bare-id title → **this orchestrator conversation itself**, ignored.
- `b68bb0d` — last cycle's impl worker (Issue #181 → PR #183): `execution_status=finished, sandbox_status=RUNNING` (post-finish lag), last update 22:40:24Z. → **finished ✓**, delivered the PR + the 22:38 UTC `Implementation Worker (Issue #181)` worklog entry at HEAD `4c6d30c` on `main`.
- → **PR slot free**; **expansion slot free**.

**Step 3 — Gather State:**

- **Open PRs:** **1** — [PR #183](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/pull/183) `feat(cli): add ohtv messages command to list user messages across conversations`. Branch `feat/messages-command-181`.
  - `lxa pr list`: `oR green ready` 💬2, **13m old**, last commit ~6m ago.
  - All checks SUCCESS: `pytest` (1m7s), `lint` (4s), `enable-orchestrator` (3s), `pr-review` (43s, finished 22:43:32Z).
  - `mergeable=MERGEABLE`, `mergeStateStatus=CLEAN`, `isDraft=false`.
  - `reviewDecision=""` — pr-review bot posted a **COMMENTED** review (verdict 🟡 **Acceptable**), not APPROVED. Two inline review threads (unresolved):
    1. `src/ohtv/cli.py` — 🟠 **Important**: pagination condition uses wrong variable; `offset + shown < total_conversations` can show "Next" when there are no more conversations to query (real bug in the new command).
    2. `src/ohtv/messages.py` — 🟡 Suggestion: duplicated `_extract_message_content` between `cli.py` and `messages.py`; non-blocking maintenance concern.
  - **Files in PR:** `src/ohtv/cli.py`, `src/ohtv/messages.py` (NEW), `tests/unit/test_messages.py` (NEW), `tests/unit/test_cli_messages.py` (NEW). **README.md NOT in the diff.** The impl worker's own worklog entry explicitly flagged `README.md`, `docs/guides/exploration.md`, and `docs/guides/search-and-ask.md` as "TODO for the docs worker once CI is fully green".
- **Issues needing expansion:** none (the only two unlabeled-as-ready issues, #26 `mcp-server` and #90 `ohtv label`, both carry the `hold` label).
- **Ready issues:** **#181** (`ready` + `priority:medium`) — in flight as PR #183. No other ready issues.

**Step 4 — Decision Tree (per orchestrate skill):**

- **Expansion slot:** no issues need expansion → **idle**.
- **PR slot:** PR exists, ready, CI green, **README not updated** AND changes affect CLI (brand-new top-level `ohtv messages` command) → **spawn docs worker**. The "Test What's Documented" principle gates testing on docs; the docs worker runs FIRST so the testing worker can verify documented examples end-to-end. The two unresolved pr-review bot threads (the 🟠 pagination bug + the 🟡 dedup suggestion) are deferred to the review worker, which fires **after** docs ✓ → test ✓ per the decision tree.
  - Note: the pagination bug is real and will surface during manual testing (the testing worker exercises empty / single-page / multi-page paths per its standard rubric). That's the intended ordering — testing catches the bug, then the review worker addresses both the bot comment AND any test-driven findings in a single round. We do NOT short-circuit docs → review just because review comments already exist; doing so would land an undocumented command.

**Step 5 — Spawn: Docs Worker (PR #183)**

| Conv ID | Type | Working On | Status |
|---------|------|------------|--------|
| `05df98c` | docs | PR #183 — README + AGENTS.md docs for `ohtv messages` | **NEW** |

- **Conversation:** [`05df98c`](https://app.all-hands.dev/conversations/05df98c1a0ec41ae9e7965c1c6b3c588) (full ID `05df98c1a0ec41ae9e7965c1c6b3c588`).
- **Start-task ID:** `e3ed893ffad14fa49882e1abaf63dc0c` — `READY` on 1st poll (~10s after POST). **11-cycle warm-picker streak holds.**
- Verified `execution_status=running, sandbox_status=RUNNING` immediately after READY.
- Plugin spec (unchanged, **31st successful spawn** in a row): `{"source": "github:jpshackelford/.openhands", "repo_path": "plugins/ohtv-workflow", "ref": "feat/ohtv-workflow-plugin"}`.
- Auth header: `X-Access-Token: $OPENHANDS_API_KEY`.
- **Prompt scope:**
  1. `gh pr checkout 183` + `uv sync` + read PR diff (`cli.py` Click definition is the source of truth for flag names + defaults).
  2. Update `README.md`:
     - Add `messages` row to the `## Commands` table.
     - Add a new `## Browsing messages by date` (or equivalent) section right after the existing `## Event-date filtering` block, since `messages` is the third sibling of `ask`/`search` and shares the `--event-dates` mechanism. Section must cover: date-range flag combinations (`--day` / `--week` / `--since` / `--until`), pagination (`-n` / `-k`), output formats (text/json/raw including the `-1` shorthand), `--full`, source/repo/label filters, and the `--event-dates` opt-in cross-linked to the existing section. Show the default text-mode output shape.
  3. Optionally update the `## Testing` block in AGENTS.md with a `uv run ohtv messages -W` one-liner, only if it fits cleanly.
  4. Commit as `docs: document ohtv messages command in README`; push; `gh pr checks 183 --watch`.
  5. Post a PR comment summarising the sections added (with the standard `_This comment was created by an AI agent (OpenHands) on behalf of @jpshackelford._` footer).
  6. Append `### YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM UTC - Docs Worker (PR #183)` to WORKLOG.md on `main` with subject `chore(worklog): docs worker for PR #183`.
- **Guardrails:** README.md + AGENTS.md only on the PR branch; WORKLOG.md only on `main`. NO code edits to `src/ohtv/cli.py` or `src/ohtv/messages.py` (the pagination bug stays for the review worker). NO PR title/description change. NO `gh pr ready --undo` (PR stays ready).

**Step 6 — Quiet-cycle check:** Productive cycle (1 worker spawned, no quiet entry). Auto-disable counter stays at **0**.

**Cycle expectations for next 1–3 cycles (~30–90 min):**

- **Next cycle (~23:20Z):** Most likely —
  - ~70%: Docs worker `05df98c` complete. README + Commands-table updated, AGENTS.md possibly touched, docs-update comment posted, CI green (markdown-only commit). Orchestrator decision: PR ready, docs ✓, NO manual test results → **spawn testing worker** for PR #183. Standard test rubric (12 paths covering format dispatch, pagination edges, source/repo/label filters, `--event-dates`, empty result).
  - ~20%: Docs worker still running (markdown-heavy section + multiple examples can stretch past one cycle if it sets up a local DB to verify output shapes). Quiet entry; PR slot blocked on docs.
  - ~7%: Docs worker decides AGENTS.md is the wrong target and only edits README.md — that's fine, AGENTS.md update was explicitly optional in the prompt.
  - ~3%: Docs worker discovers a documentation-blocking inconsistency in the CLI (e.g., a flag named differently from the issue spec) and bounces back to the review worker. Low-probability; the impl worker's own worklog explicitly named the docs files as TODO.
- **2 cycles out (~23:50Z):** Likely testing worker running (12-test rubric usually 25–45 min). The 🟠 pagination bug WILL surface here — testing will produce a `FAIL` row on the multi-page pagination path. Worklog will show test results.
- **3 cycles out (~00:20Z+1):** Most likely testing worker complete with FAIL on the pagination path; orchestrator routes to **review worker** to address both the 🟠 inline thread AND the test-driven pagination fix in one round. Less likely (~20%): testing passes (the bot's analysis is wrong / the off-by-one is benign on the cases tested) → review worker addresses 🟠 + 🟡 threads as documented review feedback.

**Notes / follow-ups carried forward (cumulative):**

- **`initial_message` spawn-payload contract** stays pinned. **31 successful spawns** in a row with `{"initial_message": {"content": [{"type":"text","text":"…"}], "run": true}}`.
- **Spawn auth header:** `X-Access-Token: $OPENHANDS_API_KEY` (header name; no `Bearer` prefix).
- **Plugin spec format unchanged:** `{"source": "github:jpshackelford/.openhands", "repo_path": "plugins/ohtv-workflow", "ref": "feat/ohtv-workflow-plugin"}`.
- **Start-task POST endpoint:** `POST /api/v1/app-conversations`. Polling: `GET /api/v1/app-conversations/start-tasks/search`. **READY on 1st poll for 11 cycles running.**
- **`GH_TOKEN` shim:** `export GH_TOKEN="${GITHUB_TOKEN:-$github_token}"` — worked again.
- **`ohtv sync` hang:** the `ohtv sync --since … --quiet` call hung past the soft timeout this cycle. Workaround: skip the sync at orchestrator entry — all decisions are off `gh` + OH API directly, the sync is only useful for `ohtv list --repo ohtv --idle` worker-activity sweeps which I haven't needed lately. If the hang recurs across cycles, file as a follow-up issue for the impl-worker side.
- **Tool install pattern stays project-local:** `.venv/bin/{ohtv,lxa}`; system-wide `--system` install still blocked by `/usr/local/lib/python3.13/site-packages` perms (12th cycle).
- **PR-review bot streak update:** PR #183 broke the COMMENTED-with-non-blocking-suggestions pattern with a **🟠 Important** rating on a real pagination bug — the bot's heuristic detected the off-by-one on the `offset + shown < total_conversations` boundary. This is the first 🟠 (vs 🟡 / no inline) review in the recent streak. Defensive: the review worker will need to verify the bot's bug claim against actual failing test output before applying the suggested fix.
- **WORKLOG truncation:** **12 consecutive cycles overdue.** Standing recommendation unchanged.
- **Reverse-chronological WORKLOG layout:** confirmed across the last several cycles — new entries are prepended after the `## Log` header, not appended at EOF. Truncation matcher needs to handle this when (if) it's rerun.
- **Idle queue context after #181:** Only `hold`-labeled issues remain (#26 mcp-server, #90 `ohtv label`). Auto-disable horizon shifts out to whenever #181 merges + 2 consecutive quiet cycles thereafter.

**Local checkout note:** `main` HEAD on entry at `4c6d30c` (impl worker's worklog commit for #183). This entry commits only WORKLOG.md as `chore(worklog):`. No code branches touched by orchestrator.

EXIT per orchestrate skill — next cycle (~30 min) checks `05df98c` status, looks for a `docs:` commit on `feat/messages-command-181` + the docs-update PR comment, and (if green) dispatches the testing worker for PR #183.

### 2026-06-04 22:38 UTC - Implementation Worker (Issue #181)

**Scope:** Implemented [Issue #181](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/issues/181) — `feat(cli): Add ohtv messages command to list user messages across conversations`. Opened [PR #183](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/pull/183) (`feat/messages-command-181`).

**Dependency:** Started off `main @ 52facbd` which already has #180 merged at `9cdbbe2` (PR #182's squash). The command calls `ConversationStore.list_by_event_date_range(...)` directly — the single SQL owner per AGENTS.md item #35, no parallel JOIN.

**Files touched (4):**

| File | LOC | Purpose |
|------|-----|---------|
| `src/ohtv/messages.py` | +349 | NEW. `UserMessage` / `ConversationMessages` dataclasses, `extract_user_messages`, `collect_messages`, `truncate_text`, `collapse_to_single_line` |
| `src/ohtv/cli.py` | +301 | NEW `messages_cmd` Click handler + 3 `_render_messages_*` helpers + `ConversationMessages` TYPE_CHECKING import |
| `tests/unit/test_messages.py` | +445 | NEW. 27 pure-Python tests (extraction, truncation, single-line collapse, `collect_messages` end-to-end with a real seeded SQLite DB) |
| `tests/unit/test_cli_messages.py` | +470 | NEW. 19 CliRunner tests (format dispatch, `-1` alias, pagination footer, source filter, `--full` truncation, empty-result hint, `--include-sub-conversations`) |

**AC coverage:** All 12 acceptance criteria from #181 ticked (see PR body). Output formats `text` / `json` / `raw` all implemented, `-1` shorthand for `--format raw`, `--full` disables 500-char truncation in text mode, empty-result path prints the engagement-stage hint, pagination is by conversation grain.

**Test results:**
- **2660 passed, 2 skipped, 3 xfailed** (baseline 2614 + 46 new). 48.78s.
- New-files ruff: clean. cli.py ruff error count unchanged at 73 (added `ConversationMessages` to the existing `TYPE_CHECKING` block so the 3 forward-ref F821s I introduced went away).
- Manual smoke: `ohtv messages --help` renders full flag table; `-D 7 -F json` returns documented shape; `-D 7` prints "No user messages in range." + hint on empty DB; `-D 7 -1` returns empty stdout (pipeline-friendly).

**CI on PR #183:** All four checks PASS — `pytest` (1m7s), `lint` (4s, conventional-commit PR title `feat(cli):…`), `enable-orchestrator` (3s), `pr-review` (was `skipping` while draft; will run now that I flipped to ready).

**State on exit:** PR #183 marked **ready for review** at 22:38 UTC. Docs worker, review-round, QA, and merge are separate workers per the contract — I am NOT continuing past `gh pr ready`. README.md, `docs/guides/exploration.md`, and the `docs/guides/search-and-ask.md` cross-reference remain TODO for the docs worker once CI is fully green.

**Deviations:** None from the AC. One minor implementation choice worth flagging:
- `total_messages` in the JSON response counts only the **displayed** groups (per the cost-ceiling note in the technical comment — walking every candidate's events to get the full-history total would defeat the lazy-load pattern). The AC didn't pin this either way; the JSON shape is documented in the PR body.

### 2026-06-04 21:46 UTC - Orchestrator

**Active Workers:**

| Conv ID | Type | Working On | Status |
|---------|------|------------|--------|
| `ea31773` | merge | PR #182 — `--event-dates` filter squash-merge | **NEW** (running, verified) |

**Step 0 — Setup:** Project-local venv already on disk from prior cycles (`uv sync` quick; `lxa` re-installed into `.venv/bin/`). System-wide install still blocked by `/usr/local/lib/python3.13/site-packages` perms (10th cycle of project-local pattern). `ohtv sync` skipped — no fresh data needed for orchestrator decision (everything was off `gh` + API directly).

**Step 0.5 — Housekeeping:** WORKLOG.md at **2361 lines** on entry. **10th consecutive cycle** the truncation skill is overdue. Standing recommendation unchanged: a human `## INSTRUCTION: archive WORKLOG.md entries older than 10h` would unblock ~1200 lines in one commit. Deferring again per the established carry-forward.

**Step 1 — Human Instructions:** None. `awk '/^```/{f=!f;next} !f && /^## INSTRUCTION:/{print}' WORKLOG.md` → empty (all `## INSTRUCTION:` matches are inside fenced code blocks in orchestrator commentary).

**Step 2 — Active Workers (pre-this-spawn):**
- Testing worker `66a5602` (PR #182, 20:55Z): **finished ✓** — `## Manual Test Results` posted ([4626107246](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/pull/182#issuecomment-4626107246)); verdict `READY FOR MERGE`, all 7 test groups (T1–T7) pass, AC1–AC6 verified, 2614 unit tests pass.
- Review worker (PR #182 round 1, 21:25Z): **finished ✓** — applied 1-line redundancy removal in `embedding_store.py` (commit `05b8500`), thread `PRRT_kwDOR9seq86HL6-x` resolved, PR flipped back to ready, CI re-green, second auto-APPROVE on `05b8500`.
- API search for `execution_status=running` confirms only this orchestrator (`2d269a1`) was running on entry.
- → **PR slot free**; **expansion slot free**.

**Step 3 — State gathered:**

- **Open PRs:** **1** — [PR #182](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/pull/182) (`feat/event-dates-filter-180`).
  - `lxa pr list`: `oAFcFA green ready` 💬0, 1h old, 18m since last commit.
  - History decode: `o` opened (impl `417d897`) → `A` approved (bot, 20:22Z) → `F` fixes (docs `58fa6a5`, 20:25Z) → `c` comment (docs marker) → `F` fixes (review round 1 `05b8500`, 21:23Z) → `A` approved again (bot on `05b8500`).
  - All 4 CI checks SUCCESS: `lint`, `pytest`, `pr-review`, `enable-orchestrator`. `reviewDecision=APPROVED`, `mergeable=MERGEABLE`.
  - 1 review thread total, **all resolved** (1/1) — `🟡 Suggestion: Condition is logically redundant…` thread `PRRT_kwDOR9seq86HL6-x` resolved by round-1 review worker.
  - Last commit `05b85002` at 21:23:07Z.
- **Issues needing expansion (no `ready`, no `hold`):** **0** 🎉 (same as 20:51Z cycle).
- **Ready issues (no `hold`):**
  - #180 (`ready`, `priority:high`) — has PR #182 in flight (about to merge).
  - #181 (`ready`, `priority:medium`) — **newly prioritized** since last orchestrator cycle. Will become the PR-slot candidate on next orchestrator wake-up after #180 merges. (The 20:51Z cycle noted #181 was waiting on `list_by_event_date_range` to land on `main` — that's exactly what PR #182's merge unblocks.)
- **On hold:** #26 (mcp server), #90 (`ohtv label` batch) — unchanged.

**Step 4 — Decision (per orchestrate decision tree):**

- **PR slot:** "PR exists, ready, CI green, test results valid, good rating, docs valid, 💬=0 unresolved" → **Spawn merge worker.** ✅
  - **Re-test check:** Last commit `05b8500` (21:23Z) is AFTER the test report (20:55Z). Heuristic check: changed file is `src/ohtv/db/stores/embedding_store.py` (a `.py` source file, not a `_test.py`). BUT the change is **1 insertion + 1 deletion**, a tautological condition simplification (`use_event_dates ⇒ has_date_filter`, so `has_date_filter or use_event_dates ≡ has_date_filter`). Per orchestrate skill: "More than 50 lines of non-test code changed" → re-test. This is 1 line. Per orchestrate skill: "Type hints added (no runtime effect)" → don't re-test. This is functionally equivalent — **a true no-op refactor with provably zero runtime difference**. **Re-test NOT required.** ✅
  - **Docs spot-check:** Review changes were 1 line in `embedding_store.py`. Did not touch any documented behavior. README is still accurate. **Docs spot-check NOT required.** ✅
- **Expansion slot:** "No issues need expansion" → **Slot idle.** ✅
  - #181 is `ready` + `priority:medium` already; will be picked up as impl-worker target after #182 merges (PR slot becomes free).

**Step 5 — Spawned: Merge Worker (PR #182)**

- PR: [#182 — feat(filter): add --event-dates to filter by engagement timestamps](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/pull/182)
- Branch: `feat/event-dates-filter-180` | Base: `main`
- Start task: `4d499dbaa33e4ce6ae22f6ca286447b3` → `app_conversation_id = ea31773551f24f069c41b9dbbe9062d5` → **READY** on the 2nd poll (~8s elapsed; `SETTING_UP_SKILLS` → `READY`). **9th cycle of fast-ready streak.**
- Conversation: [`ea31773`](https://app.all-hands.dev/conversations/ea31773551f24f069c41b9dbbe9062d5)
- Verified `execution_status=running, sandbox_status=RUNNING` immediately after READY.
- **Prompt scope:** `gh pr checkout 182` → study diff → confirm `Closes #180` in PR description (update if needed) → squash-merge via `gh pr merge 182 --squash` with subject **exactly** `feat(filter): add --event-dates to filter by engagement timestamps` (semantic-release minor-bump trigger) and body including `Closes #180` + `Co-authored-by: openhands <openhands@all-hands.dev>` trailer → verify `state: MERGED` and issue #180 `CLOSED` → watch `release.yml` workflow → log new tag (expected `ohtv-v0.29.0`-ish) → append `chore(worklog):` entry → exit. Explicit guardrails: NO code modifications, NO subject-prefix changes, STOP-and-log on `gh pr merge` failure.

**Step 6 — Quiet-cycle check:** Productive cycle (1 merge worker spawned, completing the #180 → PR #182 track end-to-end). Auto-disable counter stays at **0**.

**Cycle expectations for next 1–3 cycles (~30–90 min):**

- **Next cycle (~22:16Z):** Most likely —
  - ~75%: Merge worker `ea31773` complete. PR #182 merged, Issue #180 closed, `ohtv-v0.29.0` (or similar) tag created. PR slot now free. Orchestrator routes to: no open PR + ready issues with priority → **spawn implementation worker for Issue #181** (`feat(cli): Add ohtv messages command`, `priority:medium`). #181's expansion explicitly notes the dependency on #180's `list_by_event_date_range` which is now on `main`.
  - ~15%: Merge worker still running (the release-workflow watch step can take ~30–60s; if orchestrator catches it mid-watch, log status and re-check next cycle).
  - ~7%: Merge blocked by transient `mergeable=UNKNOWN` flicker → merge worker retries or surfaces in worklog → orchestrator decides next step.
  - ~3%: Worker stall / network hiccup → log status, next cycle re-checks.
- **2 cycles out (~22:46Z):** Likely impl worker for #181 in flight, ~30–45 min into the new command's wiring (new `ohtv messages` top-level command, `src/ohtv/messages.py` module, two-pass aggregation reusing `list_by_event_date_range`, 15+6 named tests across `test_messages.py` + `test_cli_messages.py`).
- **3 cycles out (~23:16Z):** Likely PR #183 (or whatever number GH assigns) open as draft, CI in flight. If green, docs worker queued for next cycle.
- **End-to-end #181 wall-clock:** ~3–4 hours from impl spawn → merge, mirroring the #180 → PR #182 cadence. With current pace, #181 should be merge-ready by ~tomorrow morning UTC if no human intervention.

**Notes / follow-ups carried forward (cumulative):**

- **`initial_message` spawn-payload contract** holds steady. **29 successful spawns** in a row with `{"initial_message": {"content": [{"type":"text","text":"…"}], "run": true}}` + `selected_repository` + `git_provider: github` at the top level.
- **First-attempt endpoint mistake noted:** posted initially to `/api/v1/app-conversations/start` (404 `Method Not Allowed`) before re-reading the `/spawn-conversation` skill — correct endpoint is `POST /api/v1/app-conversations` (no `/start` suffix). Carry forward to prevent re-misremembering.
- **Spawn auth header:** `X-Access-Token: $OPENHANDS_API_KEY` (no `Bearer` prefix).
- **Plugin spec format unchanged:** `{"source": "github:jpshackelford/.openhands", "repo_path": "plugins/ohtv-workflow", "ref": "feat/ohtv-workflow-plugin"}`.
- **READY-on-1st-effective-poll streak: 9 cycles** (this cycle's `ea31773` was READY in ~8s after one `SETTING_UP_SKILLS` poll).
- **PR-review bot streak (APPROVED without thread comments on first commit, single 🟡 suggestion on this one): the 🟡 wasn't a hard block but the round-1 review worker handled it cleanly. Resetting the "APPROVED without any threads" streak to 0 — but PR #182 *did* end at APPROVED + all threads resolved, so the merge gate fires correctly.
- **`reviewDecision=APPROVED` does NOT skip testing** — held again this cycle (testing already happened at 20:55Z before round-1 review).
- **`GH_TOKEN` shim:** `export GH_TOKEN="${GITHUB_TOKEN:-$github_token}"` — worked again.
- **Tool install pattern stays project-local:** `.venv/bin/{ohtv,lxa}`; system-wide `--system` install still blocked.
- **WORKLOG truncation:** 10 consecutive cycles overdue. Standing recommendation unchanged.

**Local checkout note:** `main` HEAD on entry at `5a76d85` (the review worker's worklog commit). This entry commits only WORKLOG.md as `chore(worklog):`. No code branches touched by orchestrator.

EXIT per orchestrate skill — next cycle (~30 min) checks `ea31773` status, looks for PR #182 MERGED + Issue #180 CLOSED + new release tag, and routes through the "no open PR + ready issues with priority" branch to spawn an impl worker for Issue #181.

### 2026-06-04 21:25 UTC - Review Worker (PR #182, round 1)

**Worker:** review | **Target:** PR #182 (`--event-dates` filter, Issue #180) | **Status:** ✅ done

Addressed the single unresolved pr-review-bot suggestion on PR #182: collapse the redundant `if has_date_filter or use_event_dates:` to `if has_date_filter:` in `src/ohtv/db/stores/embedding_store.py` (line 261). Justification: `use_event_dates = event_dates and has_date_filter`, so `use_event_dates ⇒ has_date_filter` and the disjunction reduces to `has_date_filter`. Purely a redundancy removal — no semantic change to the JOIN behavior.

**Sequence:**

1. `gh pr ready 182 --undo` → flipped PR to draft.
2. Located the call site via `git grep` (one hit each for `use_event_dates = event_dates and has_date_filter` and `has_date_filter or use_event_dates`, both in `embedding_store.py`).
3. Applied the suggestion via a single-line edit (1 insertion, 1 deletion).
4. Ran the full suite: `uv run pytest -q` → **2614 passed, 2 skipped, 3 xfailed** in 52.60s (matches the manual-test baseline from PR #182).
5. Committed (`05b8500`) with subject `refactor: simplify date-filter JOIN condition per review` and the SDK Co-authored-by trailer; pushed to `feat/event-dates-filter-180`.
6. `gh pr checks 182 --watch` → both `lint` (5s) and `pytest` (1m13s) green on the new commit.
7. Posted a reply to thread `PRRT_kwDOR9seq86HL6-x` referencing SHA `05b8500` + the implication explanation + AI-agent disclosure, then `resolveReviewThread` returned `isResolved: true`.
8. `gh pr ready 182` → flipped back to ready for review.

**Outcome:** PR #182 is once again APPROVED + CI-green + all review threads resolved. Ready for the next orchestrator cycle to pick up the squash-merge.

### 2026-06-04 20:55 UTC - Testing Worker (PR #182)

**Worker:** testing | **Target:** PR #182 (`--event-dates` filter, Issue #180) | **Status:** ✅ done

Ran the full manual blackbox test suite for `--event-dates` against commit `58fa6a5` and posted the report as a PR comment ([link](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/pull/182#issuecomment-4626107246)).

**Setup:** clean clone → `uv sync` → `ohtv sync --since 7d` (465 cloud confs) → `ohtv db process all` → confirmed 465 `conversation_engagement` rows.

**Results — all 7 test groups PASS, no bugs found:**

- **T1** `list ± --event-dates`: 123 vs 130 results; round-trip conv `da040c4…` (created 05-28, last event 06-04) visible only under `--event-dates` ✓
- **T2** `--day` / `--week` with `--event-dates`: 130 vs 123 (day), 194 vs 188 (week) — deltas confirm overlap semantics ✓
- **T3** bare `list --event-dates`: exit 2, message lists all four valid companion flags ✓
- **T4** `--event-dates` accepted on `search`, `ask`, `gen objs`, `gen titles`, `gen run`; bare-flag UsageError works on each (search/ask have a slightly narrower message because they don't support `--day`/`--week`) ✓
- **T5** `refs --week --event-dates` → exit 2, `Error: No such option: --event-dates` (correctly excluded) ✓
- **T6** Migration 024: both `idx_conv_engagement_first_event_ts` and `idx_conv_engagement_last_event_ts` present ✓
- **T7** INNER JOIN exclude-missing (AC5): deleted engagement row for `32d68a2…` → conv visible under `--since 30d` (2 grep hits) but absent under `--since 30d --event-dates` (0 hits); engagement row restored after test ✓
- **Unit suite:** `pytest tests/ -q` → **2614 passed, 2 skipped, 3 xfailed** in 49.65s (orchestrator brief said 2562 — local count slightly higher, no failures)

**Verdict:** ✅ **READY FOR MERGE.** All acceptance criteria AC1–AC6 verified end-to-end; docs match behavior; no surprises.

**Notes for orchestrator:**

- `gen run` has no `--dry-run`; verified flag acceptance by running the aggregate job with `-y` (LLM model warnings are unrelated — no model configured in this runtime).
- `gen objs`, `gen titles` cache-only/dry-run paths exercise the filter cleanly without touching the LLM.
- No code or doc changes needed from this worker — just the PR comment and this worklog entry.

### 2026-06-04 20:51 UTC - Orchestrator

**Active Workers:**

| Conv ID | Type | Working On | Status |
|---------|------|------------|--------|
| `66a5602` | testing | PR #182 — `--event-dates` manual blackbox tests | **NEW** (running, verified) |

**Step 0 — Setup:** Workspace had no `.venv` on entry. `uv venv .venv` + `uv pip install --python .venv/bin/python git+…/lxa.git git+…/ohtv.git` succeeded into project-local venv (same pattern as prior 9 cycles). `ohtv sync --since 4h` ran clean.

**Step 0.5 — Housekeeping:** WORKLOG.md at **2141 lines** on entry. **9th consecutive cycle** the truncation skill is overdue. Standing recommendation unchanged: a human `## INSTRUCTION: archive WORKLOG.md entries older than 10h` would unblock ~900 lines in one commit. Deferring again per the established carry-forward.

**Step 1 — Human Instructions:** None. `grep -A5 "## INSTRUCTION:" WORKLOG.md` → empty.

**Step 2 — Active Workers (pre-this-spawn):** Per the most recent worklog entries:
- Docs Worker (PR #182, `58fa6a5`, 20:30Z): **finished ✓** — README `## Event-date filtering` section added; PR comment posted (`Documentation updated for: --event-dates filter flag (6 commands)`).
- Implementation Worker (Issue #180 → PR #182, `417d897`, 19:55Z): **finished ✓** — PR ready, CI green, 22 new tests, 6-command threading.
- Expansion Worker (Issue #181, `1498695`, 19:55Z): **finished ✓** — `ready` label applied; Technical Approach comment posted.
- API search for `execution_status=running` confirms the only ohtv-attributable running conv is this orchestrator (`beb4845`). The 19:46Z orchestrator's "~50%: both workers still running" prediction for this cycle landed in the 25% slice (both complete + docs worker has slotted in and out).
- → **PR slot free**; **expansion slot free**.

**Step 3 — State gathered:**

- **Open PRs:** **1** — [PR #182](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/pull/182) (`feat/event-dates-filter-180`).
  - `lxa pr list`: `oAFc green ready` 💬1 (31m old, 21m since last commit).
  - History decode: `o` = opened (impl worker, `417d897`) → `A` = approved (review bot, 20:22:25Z, `APPROVED`) → `F` = fixes pushed (docs commit `58fa6a5`, 20:25:46Z) → `c` = comment (docs worker's "Documentation updated" comment, 20:27:36Z).
  - CI: `lint ✓` + `pytest ✓` (last commit `58fa6a5`, 20:25:46Z). `reviewDecision=APPROVED`, `mergeable=MERGEABLE`.
  - 1 PR comment = docs worker's marker comment. **0 manual test results**. **0 unresolved review threads.**
- **Issues needing expansion (no `ready`, no `hold`):** **0** 🎉 — Both #180 and #181 have been expanded; #180 has merged-track status (PR #182), #181 is `ready` awaiting prioritization.
- **Ready issues (no `hold`):**
  - #180 (`ready`, `priority:high`) — has PR #182 in flight.
  - #181 (`ready`, no priority) — awaiting prioritization but blocked behind #180's merge per the expansion worker's documented dependency note (#181's `messages` command needs `list_by_event_date_range` on `main`).
- **On hold:** #26 (mcp server), #90 (`ohtv label` batch) — unchanged.

**Step 4 — Decision (per orchestrate decision tree):**

- **PR slot:** "PR exists, ready, CI green, docs updated, **no manual test results**" → **Spawn testing worker.** ✅
  - Both docs markers satisfied (PR comment matches `Documentation updated` pattern; README.md is in the PR diff per `gh pr diff 182 --name-only`).
  - The `reviewDecision=APPROVED` from the review bot does NOT short-circuit testing — per the orchestrate workflow's "Test What's Documented" principle, manual testing is a REQUIRED gate before merge regardless of review state.
- **Expansion slot:** "No issues need expansion" → **Slot idle.** ✅
  - #181 is already `ready`; no other open non-hold issues exist. Cannot spawn an impl worker for #181 because the PR slot is occupied by PR #182's testing phase (single-worker-per-slot rule).

**Step 5 — Spawned: Testing Worker (PR #182)**

- PR: [#182 — feat(filter): add --event-dates to filter by engagement timestamps](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/pull/182)
- Branch: `feat/event-dates-filter-180`
- Start task: `f1b422c96efc4b518dccc9ca95b80227` → `app_conversation_id = 66a56022c3d14defb82f2f4646489794` → **READY** on the 1st poll (~4s; warm-picker streak continues — 8th cycle).
- Conversation: [`66a5602`](https://app.all-hands.dev/conversations/66a56022c3d14defb82f2f4646489794)
- Verified `execution_status=running, sandbox_status=RUNNING` immediately after READY.
- **Prompt scope:** clone + `uv sync` + `pytest` (re-confirm 2562 passing) → `ohtv sync` + `ohtv db process all` to populate `conversation_engagement` → 7 numbered tests (T1–T7) covering: baseline vs `--event-dates` on `list --since 7d`, `--day`/`--week` variants, bare-flag UsageError (AC6), the other 5 commands (`search` / `ask --no-temporal` / `gen objs --cache-only` / `gen titles --dry-run` / `gen run --dry-run`), `refs` excluded (T5 = unrecognized-option assertion), migration 024 indexes (`sqlite3 .schema conversation_engagement`), and the INNER-JOIN exclude-missing semantics (AC5) using a LEFT JOIN probe to find an unengagement-rowed conv → post structured `## Manual Test Results` PR comment via `/manual-test` skill → exit (NOT merge — separate worker).

**Step 6 — Quiet-cycle check:** Productive cycle (1 worker spawned, gating PR #182 toward merge). Auto-disable counter stays at **0**.

**Cycle expectations for next 1–3 cycles (~30–90 min):**

- **Next cycle (~21:21Z):** Most likely —
  - ~55%: Testing worker `66a5602` still running. T1–T7 across 6 commands is a ~25–40 min job; the orchestrator may catch it mid-run. Action: log status, no spawn.
  - ~30%: Testing worker complete with `✅ READY FOR MERGE` verdict posted. PR #182 has manual test results + APPROVED + green CI + docs updated → **next orchestrator routes through "test results valid, good rating, docs valid" → spawn merge worker.** No re-test needed (no commits between docs commit and the test report). No docs spot-check needed (the docs commit IS the latest commit; nothing changed after it).
  - ~10%: Testing worker complete with `❌ ISSUES FOUND`. Orchestrator routes to review worker (treats the test report as review feedback). Less likely given the PR is already bot-APPROVED and 22 unit tests pass.
  - ~5%: Worker stall / network hiccup → log status, next cycle re-checks.
- **2 cycles out (~21:51Z):** Likely PR #182 merge worker in flight (or just-merged). Issue #180 closes via `Fixes #180`. `feat:` subject triggers minor version bump → `ohtv-v0.29.0` tag + CHANGELOG entry per AGENTS.md release contract.
- **3 cycles out (~22:21Z):** PR #182 merged. Issue #181 becomes the new PR-slot candidate. Orchestrator runs `/assess-priority` inline on #181 (sole `ready` issue → priority bookkeeping) and spawns an implementation worker for it. `list_by_event_date_range` is now on `main` and ready to be reused by the `messages` command per the expansion worker's documented seam.
- **End-to-end #180 + #181 wall-clock:** still tracking the 19:46Z estimate of ~3–4 hours from spawn-time — currently ~1h25m in; on pace for #180 merge by ~21:51Z and #181 PR ready by ~22:51Z–23:21Z.

**Notes / follow-ups carried forward (cumulative):**

- **`initial_message` spawn-payload contract** holds steady. **28 successful spawns** in a row with `{"initial_message": {"content": [{"type":"text","text":"…"}], "run": true}}`.
- **Spawn auth header:** `X-Access-Token: $OPENHANDS_API_KEY` (no `Bearer` prefix).
- **Plugin spec format unchanged:** `{"source": "github:jpshackelford/.openhands", "repo_path": "plugins/ohtv-workflow", "ref": "feat/ohtv-workflow-plugin"}`.
- **READY-on-1st-poll streak: 8 cycles** (this cycle's `66a5602` was READY in ~4s).
- **PR-review bot streak (APPROVED without thread comments): 4 in a row** (PRs #175, #178, #179, #182). The COMMENTED+🟢-tag fallback path may now be safely retired; left in as a defensive branch for one more cycle.
- **`reviewDecision=APPROVED` does NOT skip testing** — the orchestrate workflow explicitly states testing is required even after review begins, because docs/testing/review are sequenced separately. This cycle exercised exactly that branch; the decision tree handled it cleanly.
- **`GH_TOKEN` shim:** `export GH_TOKEN="${GITHUB_TOKEN:-$github_token}"` — worked again.
- **Tool install pattern stays project-local:** `.venv/bin/{ohtv,lxa}`; system-wide `--system` install still blocked by `/usr/local/lib/python3.13/site-packages` perms.
- **WORKLOG truncation:** 9 consecutive cycles overdue. Standing recommendation unchanged. The 6h-productive-window matcher continues to defer truncation because most prior entries were within the matcher's "keep" radius until very recently — file should now have ~1200+ archivable lines if a human applies the `## INSTRUCTION:` route.

**Local checkout note:** `main` HEAD on entry at `5a76d85` (the docs worker's worklog commit). This entry commits only WORKLOG.md as `chore(worklog):`. No code branches touched by orchestrator.

EXIT per orchestrate skill — next cycle (~30 min) checks `66a5602` status, looks for a `## Manual Test Results` PR comment on #182, and routes through the merge-or-review branches.

### 2026-06-04 20:30 UTC - Docs Worker (PR #182, `58fa6a5`)

✅ **README documentation added for `--event-dates` filter flag (Issue #180 / PR [#182](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/pull/182))** — `docs: document --event-dates filter flag in README`

- **Scope:** README-only. New top-level `## Event-date filtering` section inserted after the existing `## Engagement filtering` section (same `--since` / `--until` axis → adjacency is intentional).
- **Section contents (~49 lines):** one-paragraph motivation, explicit list of the 6 affected commands (`list`, `search`, `ask`, `gen objs`, `gen titles`, `gen run`) with the `refs`-excluded note, single-row flag table with overlap-vs-one-bound semantics, the **round-trip example** lifted from the PR description (the strongest hook from #180's motivation), 3 example commands across `list` / `search` / `gen objs`, AC6 bare-flag UsageError warning, AC5 INNER JOIN exclude-on-missing semantics + `conversation_engagement` prerequisite, deep-link to `docs/guides/exploration.md#filtering-by-event-timestamps---event-dates` for the full per-command table.
- **No duplication of the long-form guide.** README intentionally stops at the round-trip + 3 examples and links out for per-command depth (same shape as the existing Engagement-filtering section).
- **No other files touched** per the orchestrator brief: no code, no tests, no AGENTS.md (the impl worker already updated item #35), no other docs (`docs/guides/exploration.md` was pre-existing in the PR — trusted as-is).
- **CI re-verified green after the docs commit:** `lint-pr-title/lint ✓` (4s) + `tests/pytest ✓` (1m16s). `pr-review` already COMPLETED on the impl-worker commit — left untouched per brief.
- **PR comment posted** ([4625832104](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/pull/182#issuecomment-4625832104)) in the exact format the orchestrator's docs-watcher matches: `Documentation updated for: --event-dates filter flag (6 commands)`.
- **PR #182 ready for testing-worker pickup on the next orchestrator cycle** — docs gate cleared, CI green, no merge action taken (not docs worker's job per guardrails).

---

### 2026-06-04 19:55 UTC - Implementation Worker (`417d897`)

✅ **Implemented Issue #180 → PR [#182](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/pull/182)** — `feat(filter): add --event-dates to filter by engagement timestamps`

- **CI green:** lint ✓, pytest ✓ (2562 passing, 0 regressions), enable-orchestrator ✓.
- **PR is ready for review** (moved from draft); review bot triggered.
- **22 new tests** across `tests/unit/db/stores/test_conversation_store_event_dates.py` (10 — predicate semantics, INNER JOIN exclude-missing, roots-only, source filter, ordering, migration 024 indexes) and `tests/unit/test_cli_event_dates_filter.py` (12 — round-trip behavioral, parametrized validation across 4 commands, empty-result hint, search FTS post-filter).
- **Migration 024** (`024_engagement_event_ts_indexes.py`) adds covering indexes on `conversation_engagement.first_event_ts` / `last_event_ts`.
- **Single SQL owner:** `ConversationStore.list_by_event_date_range` is the only place the engagement-overlap WHERE clause lives — Issue #181 will extend it rather than fork it.
- **Threaded through:** `list`, `search`, `ask`, `gen objs`, `gen titles`, `gen run` (NOT `refs` per spec). Default-off; back-compat preserved.
- **Validation gate** (`_validate_event_dates_args`) fires at the right seam in each command — for `gen titles` / `gen run` it runs BEFORE the default 30-day / last-4-periods window to prevent silent mode swap on the default range.
- **Docs:** `docs/guides/exploration.md` gains a new "Filtering by event timestamps" subsection with the round-trip example; AGENTS.md item #35 captures the architectural decisions for future implementers (including the search FTS post-filter chunking, INNER JOIN semantics, and the #181 follow-up seam).
- **Conventional-commit subject** confirmed: `feat(filter): …` → triggers minor bump on merge per the release contract.

---

### 2026-06-04 19:55 UTC - Expansion Worker (`1498695`)

✅ **Expanded Issue #181** — `feat(cli): Add ohtv messages command to list user messages across conversations`

- **Status:** Ready for implementation; `ready` label applied.
- **Type:** Enhancement (new top-level command).
- **Body rewrite:** Problem Statement / Proposed Solution / Acceptance Criteria / Output Format (text + json + raw) / Usage Examples / Flags / Out of Scope / Dependencies. Preserved & extended all human-provided examples; added the "When you remember…" decision table to position `messages` next to `ask`/`search`.
- **Technical Approach comment** ([4625613300](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/issues/181#issuecomment-4625613300)): proposes new `src/ohtv/messages.py` module + CLI handler in `cli.py`; two-pass aggregation (DB candidates via #180's `list_by_event_date_range` → lazy event load only for displayed window); reuses `_load_events`, `_extract_message_content`, `_parse_date_filters`, `_apply_conversation_filters` non-date branches; pagination by *conversation* not message; 500-char truncation + `--full`; `text` / `json` / `raw` formats with `-1` ≡ `raw` shorthand; full per-test-file plan (`test_messages.py` + `test_cli_messages.py`, 15+6 named tests); doc updates for `docs/guides/exploration.md` + `README.md`.
- **Dependency on #180 documented:** Strict blocker. `messages` is the *only mode* event-time (no `--event-dates` flag — implicit always). Implementation must start after `list_by_event_date_range` + migration 024 land on `main`. Suggested priority `:medium` (queued behind #180's `:high`).
- **Out-of-scope explicitly listed:** agent messages, in-message FTS, pre-aggregated `messages` table (called out as natural follow-up if Pass-2 disk loads become a bottleneck, but not v1).
- **No code touched** per orchestrator brief (expansion slot, parallel to #180 implementation worker `417d897`).

### 2026-06-04 19:46 UTC - Orchestrator

**Active Workers:**

| Conv ID | Type | Working On | Status |
|---------|------|------------|--------|
| `417d897` | implementation | Issue #180 — `--event-dates` flag | **NEW** (running, verified) |
| `1498695` | expansion | Issue #181 — `ohtv messages` command | **NEW** (running, verified) |

**Step 0 — Setup:** Workspace had no `.venv` on entry. `uv venv .venv` + `uv pip install git+…/lxa.git git+…/ohtv.git` succeeded into `.venv/bin/`. System-wide `--system` install blocked by `/usr/local/lib/python3.13/site-packages` perms (same known constraint as prior cycles). `main` HEAD on entry at `b9ebf0f` (the 19:27Z expansion-worker commit for #180). `ohtv sync` ran clean.

**Step 0.5 — Housekeeping:** WORKLOG.md at **2005 lines** on entry. **8th consecutive cycle** the truncation skill is overdue but the 6h-productive-window matcher continues to yield <50 lines per the standing carry-forward. Same standing recommendation: a human `## INSTRUCTION: archive WORKLOG.md entries older than 10h` would unblock ~800 lines in one commit. Deferring again.

**Step 1 — Human Instructions:** None. `grep -A5 "## INSTRUCTION:" WORKLOG.md | grep -v ACKNOWLEDGED` → only orchestrator commentary, no actionable `## INSTRUCTION:` blocks.

**Step 2 — Active Workers (pre-this-spawn):**
- Expansion worker `21541ba` (spawned 19:20Z for #180): per the 19:27Z worklog entry → **finished ✓** with `ready` label applied to #180 and a Technical Approach comment ([issue 4625421483](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/issues/180#issuecomment-4625421483)) posted. API search confirms no `running` conversations attributable to past workers; the only `running` row is this orchestrator (`f67967b`, started at 19:46:07Z — matches the current-cycle timestamp).
- → **PR slot free**; **expansion slot free**.

**Step 3 — State gathered:**
- **Open PRs:** **0** (`gh pr list --state open` → `[]`). The 19:20Z orchestrator's "PR for #180 ready + green → docs worker" prediction is paced one cycle behind — the impl worker hasn't been spawned yet (this cycle's job).
- **Issues needing expansion (no `ready`, no `hold`):** **#181** — `feat(cli): Add ohtv messages command`. The only unexpanded open issue.
- **Ready issues (no `hold`):** **#180** — `feat(filter): Add --event-dates flag`. **Not prioritized on entry** — the 19:27Z expansion worker suggested `priority:medium` but explicitly deferred setting the label to the orchestrator per the `/assess-priority` convention.
- **On hold:** #26 (mcp server), #90 (`ohtv label` batch) — unchanged.
- **Latest release:** `ohtv-v0.28.0` (from PR #178 merge ~2h ago). No tag bump from the #173 / PR #179 `refactor:` merge (correct per AGENTS.md release contract).

**Step 4 — Priority assessment (inline `/assess-priority`):**

- Considered: **single ready issue**, so the assessment is straightforward — no tie-breaking needed against other ready candidates.
- **Overridden to `priority:high`** (above the expansion worker's `priority:medium` recommendation) on two grounds:
  1. **Hard dependency on #181:** the 19:27Z expansion explicitly notes "#181 (`ohtv messages`) is queued behind this one — its issue body explicitly cites #180 as the efficient query path; implementation can call `list_by_event_date_range` directly once landed." Promoting #180 to `:high` minimizes wall-clock to unblock #181.
  2. **Critical-path solo issue:** with #180 + #181 the only non-hold queue, the ready queue effectively serializes on #180 anyway. `:high` vs `:medium` here is mostly bookkeeping but makes the dependency explicit for any future orchestrator cycle.
- Applied via: `gh issue edit 180 --add-label "priority:high"` → ✅ accepted (label already exists in the repo — `priority:high|medium|low` are the three options).

**Step 5 — Decision (per orchestrate decision tree):**

- **PR slot:** "No open PR + ready issues with priority" → **Spawn implementation worker.** ✅
  - Only viable target = #180 (the only `ready` + prioritized issue post-step-4).
- **Expansion slot:** "Issues need expansion (no `ready`, no `hold`)" → **Spawn expansion worker.** ✅
  - Only viable target = #181 (the only unexpanded open issue).
- Both spawned **in parallel** — first parallel-spawn cycle since the 14:30Z and 15:50Z runs. Decision-tree confirms both slots are free and both have work.

**Step 6 — Spawned: 2 Workers (parallel)**

1. **Implementation Worker (#180)**
   - Issue: [#180 — feat(filter): Add --event-dates flag](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/issues/180) (`priority:high`)
   - Start task: `c9143cee86144c6d8e55d7025a4444ca` → `app_conversation_id = 417d897b9c5442168769f924c41947a7` → **READY** on the 1st poll (~8s; warm-picker).
   - Conversation: [`417d897`](https://app.all-hands.dev/conversations/417d897b9c5442168769f924c41947a7)
   - Verified `execution_status=running, sandbox_status=RUNNING` immediately after READY.
   - **Prompt scope:** read issue #180 body + technical-approach comment → branch from `main` at `b9ebf0f` → implement (migration 024 with two indexes; `ConversationStore.list_by_event_date_range` with overlap SQL; thread `event_dates: bool` through `_apply_conversation_filters` + `EmbeddingStore.search`/`search_conversations`/`get_context_for_rag`; new `event_date_options` decorator on all 6 commands; UsageError on bare `--event-dates`; missing-engagement-row exclusion + hint) → 7 new test categories per the expansion comment → green CI on `pytest`/`lint`/`enable-orchestrator` → flip draft → ready → `chore(worklog):` exit. Conv-commit subject MUST be `feat:` (minor version bump per AGENTS.md release contract — explicitly flagged in prompt).

2. **Expansion Worker (#181)**
   - Issue: [#181 — feat(cli): Add `ohtv messages` command](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/issues/181)
   - Start task: `d3b766a013ee41e6b2ba313cbe67c177` → `app_conversation_id = 149869506d714fd6bf440f3f020d18a9` → **READY** on the 1st poll (~8s).
   - Conversation: [`1498695`](https://app.all-hands.dev/conversations/149869506d714fd6bf440f3f020d18a9)
   - Verified `execution_status=running, sandbox_status=RUNNING` immediately after READY.
   - **Prompt scope:** read issue #181 body → explore event-loading + date-filter plumbing (`src/ohtv/exporter.py`, `_apply_conversation_filters`, `_parse_date_filters`) → call out **#180 dependency explicitly** in the rewritten body (so the impl worker doesn't start before #180 lands) → propose per-conv aggregation strategy (event-scan vs cache vs new DB column — recommend a starting point, leave the call to the impl worker) → format-options + pagination semantics → test plan + doc updates → risks (large-range event scans). Add `ready` label only when fully expanded; `needs-info` / `needs-split` if blocked. Worklog exit with `chore(worklog):`.

**Step 7 — Quiet-cycle check:** Productive cycle (2 workers spawned in parallel). Auto-disable counter stays at **0**. The 19:20Z orchestrator's "first all-quiet cycle likely at ~19:20Z; auto-disable counter → 1" prediction did **not** play out — two new issues filed by @jpshackelford at 18:37/18:38Z reopened the queue.

**Cycle expectations for next 1–3 cycles (~30–90 min):**

- **Next cycle (~20:16Z):** Most likely —
  - ~50%: Both workers still running. Impl worker `417d897` is ~30–45 min into a ~60–90 min full-stack feature (6 commands + migration + 7 test categories). Expansion worker `1498695` is ~20–35 min into a typical expansion. Orchestrator: log status, no action.
  - ~25%: Expansion `1498695` complete (`ready` label on #181, Technical Approach comment posted). Impl `417d897` still running on #180 (draft PR not yet open). Orchestrator: PR slot still occupied → log status, no new spawn (#181 has to wait for #180 PR cycle to clear).
  - ~15%: Both workers complete. Impl worker has draft-or-ready PR for #180 with CI in flight. Orchestrator routes through the post-impl decision branches (docs worker, since `--event-dates` is a NEW user-facing flag → README + `docs/guides/exploration.md` update required per the "When Docs Update is Required" list).
  - ~10%: Worker stall / blockage → log status, next cycle re-checks.
- **2 cycles out (~20:46Z):** Likely impl `417d897` finished, PR for #180 open + green → docs worker spawned (CRITICAL: this is a NEW CLI flag — docs worker is required before testing per the orchestrate workflow's "test what's documented" principle). Expansion `1498695` likely complete by now, #181 `ready` and prioritized.
- **3 cycles out (~21:16Z):** PR for #180 likely in testing or review phase. Two-feature mini-cycle in motion.
- **After #180 merges (~21:46Z–22:16Z?):** #181 impl worker spawned (it'll be `ready` + prioritized by then). End-to-end #180 + #181 wall-clock estimate: ~3–4 hours from this cycle, barring re-review rounds.

**Notes / follow-ups carried forward (cumulative):**

- **`initial_message` spawn-payload contract** stays pinned. **26 + 27 successful spawns** in a row (2 this cycle) with `{"initial_message": {"content": [{"type":"text","text":"…"}], "run": true}}`.
- **Spawn auth header:** `X-Access-Token: $OPENHANDS_API_KEY` (header name; no `Bearer` prefix).
- **Plugin spec format unchanged:** `{"source": "github:jpshackelford/.openhands", "repo_path": "plugins/ohtv-workflow", "ref": "feat/ohtv-workflow-plugin"}`.
- **Start-task POST endpoint:** `POST /api/v1/app-conversations`. Polling: `GET /api/v1/app-conversations/start-tasks/search`. Both spawns READY on 1st poll (~8s) — warm-picker streak continues (7th cycle).
- **`GH_TOKEN` shim:** `export GH_TOKEN="${GITHUB_TOKEN:-$github_token}"` — worked again.
- **Tool install pattern this cycle:** workspace had NO `.venv` pre-existing (same as 17:48Z). `uv venv .venv` + `uv pip install git+…/lxa.git git+…/ohtv.git` succeeded into project-local venv. System-wide `--system` install still blocked by `/usr/local/lib/python3.13/site-packages` perms. Pinning project-venv as the working pattern.
- **Single-conversation GET endpoint glitch carried forward:** `GET /api/v1/app-conversations?ids=ID1,ID2` returns a JSON shape that breaks `jq '.[] | {…}'`. Workaround: use `GET /api/v1/app-conversations/search?limit=20` + `jq '.items[] | select(.id == "…" or .id == "…") | {…}'`. **Pin search-based verification for future cycles.**
- **`/assess-priority` inline path validated:** sole-ready-issue + downstream-dependency → `priority:high`. Bookkeeping more than ranking, but the explicit label makes the dependency chain visible to any future orchestrator.
- **PR-review bot APPROVED-without-threads streak:** 3 in a row (PR #175 / #178 / #179). The COMMENTED+🟢-tag fallback path may now be dead; watch for one more cycle.
- **WORKLOG truncation:** 8 consecutive cycles overdue. Standing recommendation unchanged.

**Local checkout note:** `main` HEAD on entry at `b9ebf0f`. This entry commits only WORKLOG.md as `chore(worklog):`. No code branches touched by orchestrator.

EXIT per orchestrate skill — next cycle (~30 min) checks both `417d897` and `1498695` status, looks for a draft PR for #180 with `Fixes #180` and a `ready` label + Technical Approach comment on #181, and routes through the post-impl decision branches.

### 2026-06-04 19:27 UTC - Expansion worker (Issue #180)

**Outcome:** ✅ Expanded Issue [#180](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/issues/180) — `feat(filter): Add --event-dates flag to filter by event timestamps instead of conversation created_at`. `ready` label applied.

- **Type:** Enhancement (new CLI flag on 6 commands: `list`, `search`, `ask`, `gen objs`, `gen titles`, `gen run`).
- **Issue body** rewritten with Problem Statement, Proposed Solution (predicate table), Acceptance Criteria (9 boxes), Out of Scope, Verification, and the `_This issue was expanded by…_` footer.
- **[Technical Approach comment](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/issues/180#issuecomment-4625421483)** posted covering: data-layer verification (migration 023 + `process_engagement` stage + `_load_engagement_for_ids` helper from PR #179), the per-command integration map with exact line numbers in `src/ohtv/cli.py`, the proposed `ConversationStore.list_by_event_date_range` signature with overlap-semantics SQL, the `event_date_options` decorator (no `-E` short flag — collides with `--with-errors` on `list` at `cli.py:3005`), migration 024 template (two `CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS` statements; auto-applied via `ensure_db_ready` per AGENTS.md item #25), the test-coverage gap list (7 new test files/cases), doc-update locations (`exploration.md` lines 132-133, `search-and-ask.md` temporal section, README line 78), risk call-outs for `ask` × temporal-query-extraction, and an explicit out-of-scope verdict for `refs` / `errors` / `report *`.
- **Key validation findings during discovery:**
  - Migration 023 (`src/ohtv/db/migrations/023_conversation_engagement.py`) defines `first_event_ts` / `last_event_ts` as proposed; only `idx_conv_engagement_threshold` exists today — the two new indexes are genuinely needed.
  - `process_engagement` writes a row for **every** processed conversation (even fire-and-forget, `engaged_seconds=0`), so "no engagement row" cleanly means "stage hasn't run yet for this conv", not "no events".
  - `_apply_conversation_filters` (`cli.py:2462`) is the central filter helper for `list` + 3 `gen` commands — single insertion point for the `event_dates: bool` plumbing.
  - `search` / `ask` route through `EmbeddingStore.search` (`embedding_store.py:240-282`), which already JOINs `conversations` for date filtering — extending it to JOIN `conversation_engagement` instead is one branch.
  - No shared `--since` / `--until` decorator exists today; each command declares its own option. Recommend a new `event_date_options` decorator paralleling `engagement_filter_options` (`cli.py:2271`).
  - `-E` short flag already taken by `list --with-errors` — recommended no short flag for `--event-dates`.
  - **Recommended UsageError**: `--event-dates` without any of `--since` / `--until` / `--day` / `--week` should exit 2 with a clear message; silent no-op is a worse trap.
- **Suggested priority:** `priority:medium` — quality-of-life improvement; unblocks #181. Did NOT set the label myself per the orchestrator's `/assess-priority` skill convention.
- **#181 (`ohtv messages`) is queued behind this one** — its issue body explicitly cites #180 as the efficient query path; implementation can call `list_by_event_date_range` directly once landed.
- No blockers — engagement table is populated by the existing post-sync stage pipeline; legacy gaps heal on next `ohtv sync`. No `needs-info` / `needs-split` warranted.

### 2026-06-04 19:20 UTC - Orchestrator

**Active Workers:**

| Conv ID | Type | Working On | Status |
|---------|------|------------|--------|
| `21541ba` | expansion | Issue #180 — `--event-dates` flag | **NEW** (running, verified) |

**Step 0 — Setup:** Workspace `main` at `18adbd5` (the 18:52Z merge-worker commit for PR #179 / Issue #173). `uv sync` populated `.venv/` cleanly; `lxa` installed via `uv pip install git+…/lxa.git` (project-venv path). `ohtv` from local editable checkout. Same install pattern as the 17:48Z and earlier 6 cycles.

**Step 0.5 — Housekeeping:** WORKLOG.md at **1890 lines** on entry. **7th consecutive cycle** the truncation skill is overdue but the 6h-productive-window matcher continues to yield <50 lines. Standing recommendation unchanged: a human `## INSTRUCTION: archive WORKLOG.md entries older than 10h` would unblock ~700 lines in one commit. Deferring again.

**Step 1 — Human Instructions:** None. `awk '/^```/{f=!f;next} !f && /^## INSTRUCTION:/{print}' WORKLOG.md` → empty.

**Step 2 — Active Workers (pre-this-spawn):**
- Implementation worker `871fa09` (spawned 17:48Z for #173): per the 17:55Z worklog entry → **finished ✓** with draft-PR-to-ready flip on PR #179.
- Subsequent testing/review/merge workers for PR #179 ran outside this WORKLOG (no entries between 17:55Z and now). End-state on GitHub: **PR #179 squash-merged at 18:50:46Z** by the merge worker (commit `fa4056d`), worklog updated by that worker at 18:52:56Z (`18adbd5` — the current HEAD). Issue #173 auto-closed via `Closes #173`. Release workflow correctly no-op'd on the `refactor:` subject (no tag, no CHANGELOG entry); latest tag remains `ohtv-v0.28.0`.
- → **PR slot free**; **expansion slot free**.

**Step 3 — State gathered:**

- **Open PRs:** **0** (`gh pr list --state open` → `[]`). The 17:48Z orchestrator's "next pickup source is expansion of new issues if any get filed" prediction landed exactly — two new issues filed by @jpshackelford at 18:37Z and 18:38Z.
- **Issues needing expansion (no `ready`, no `hold`):**
  - **#180** (18:37:45Z) — `feat(filter): Add --event-dates flag to filter by event timestamps instead of conversation created_at`. Well-formed proposal with concrete data-layer plan (uses `conversation_engagement` table from migration 023, adds indexes on `first_event_ts` / `last_event_ts`, adds `list_by_event_date_range()` on `ConversationStore`, adds `--event-dates`/`-E` flag via shared decorator). Names the 6 affected commands: `list`, `search`, `ask`, `gen objs`, `gen titles`, `gen run`.
  - **#181** (18:38:09Z) — `feat(cli): Add ohtv messages command to list user messages across conversations`. Proposes a new `ohtv messages` command that **uses event-timestamp filtering** — so implementation depends on #180's plumbing landing first.
- **Ready, prioritized issues:** **0** (post-#173 merge, the queue drained as predicted).
- **On hold:** #26 (mcp server), #90 (`ohtv label` batch) — unchanged.

**Step 4 — Decision (per orchestrate decision tree):**

- **PR slot:** "No open PR + no ready issues" → **nothing to implement.** ✅ (Wait for expansion.)
- **Expansion slot:** "Issues need expansion (no `ready`, no `hold`)" → **Spawn expansion worker for the oldest unexpanded issue.** ✅ → **#180** wins on `created_at` (issue-number ordering trivially agrees: 180 < 181).

**Selection rationale:** #180 is upstream of #181 in the dependency graph — #181's `ohtv messages` command needs event-timestamp filtering, which is what #180 introduces as a reusable shared-decorator primitive. Expanding #180 first will surface the exact `ConversationStore.list_by_event_date_range()` signature that #181's expansion can then build on without re-discovering it.

**Step 5 — Spawned: Expansion Worker**

- Issue: [#180 — feat(filter): Add --event-dates flag](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/issues/180)
- Start task: `29327270` → `app_conversation_id = 21541ba43d344ca2bedd71dfd5719d61` → **READY** on the 2nd poll (~8s).
- Conversation: [`21541ba`](https://app.all-hands.dev/conversations/21541ba43d344ca2bedd71dfd5719d61)
- Verified `execution_status=running, sandbox_status=RUNNING` immediately after the READY transition.
- Plugin spec (unchanged, **25th successful spawn** in a row): `{"source": "github:jpshackelford/.openhands", "repo_path": "plugins/ohtv-workflow", "ref": "feat/ohtv-workflow-plugin"}`.
- Spawn payload contract (unchanged, V1): `initial_message: {content: [{type:"text", text:"…"}], run: true}`.
- Auth header: `X-Access-Token: $OPENHANDS_API_KEY`.
- **Prompt scope (8 expansion tasks, condensed):**
  1. Verify prerequisite data layer (migration 023 `conversation_engagement`; whether `db scan` populates it; identify `_load_engagement_for_ids` helper just refactored in PR #179).
  2. Map integration points for all 6 commands listed in the issue (`list` / `search` / `ask` / `gen objs` / `gen titles` / `gen run`) — quote where `--since`/`--until` reaches the store today.
  3. Confirm new `ConversationStore.list_by_event_date_range(since, until, ...)` signature with overlap semantics; spell out behavior for conversations without engagement rows; note `source='local'` vs `'cloud'` (AGENTS.md item #14 dashed-ID contract).
  4. Locate existing `--since`/`--until` shared decorator; extend with `--event-dates`/`-E`; check for short-flag collisions; decide error vs no-op when `--event-dates` is bare.
  5. Confirm next migration number, copy a recent migration as template, verify `ensure_db_ready()` will pick it up (AGENTS.md item #25).
  6. List specific new tests needed in `tests/unit/test_date_filters.py` / `tests/unit/test_cli_list_engagement.py`.
  7. Identify README + `docs/guides/` sections to update (impl worker writes them, not expansion).
  8. Risk call-outs: how does `--event-dates` interact with the `ask` temporal-extraction layer? Should `refs` and `errors` get the flag (issue doesn't list them)?
- **Deliverables:** rewrite #180 body (Problem / Solution / AC), post a separate `Technical Approach` comment, add `ready` label, suggest `priority:medium` in the comment (do NOT set priority — that's orchestrator's `/assess-priority` job), append `chore(worklog):` entry noting that #181 is queued behind #180.
- **Blocked-paths spelled out:** engagement table not populated → `needs-info`; approach diverges from issue body → ask human; should be split → `needs-split`. Do NOT add `ready` if blocked.
- **AI-disclosure footer:** required on both the rewritten body and the Technical Approach comment.

**Step 6 — Quiet-cycle check:** Productive cycle (1 worker spawned). Auto-disable counter stays at **0**. (Quiet-cycle window correctly did NOT trigger — there was work to pick up.)

**Cycle expectations for next 1–3 cycles (~30–90 min):**

- **Next cycle (~19:50Z):** Most likely —
  - ~55%: Expansion worker `21541ba` still running. The codebase-discovery tasks (verifying migration 023, mapping 6 command integration points, locating the shared decorator) typically take 20–35 min for a thorough expansion. Orchestrator decision tree: no other slots to fill → quiet entry.
  - ~30%: Expansion completed, `ready` label added on #180. Orchestrator decision tree: "Ready, not prioritized" → run `/assess-priority` inline → spawn implementation worker for #180 (assuming priority assessment puts it in the queue). #181 expansion still slot-blocked unless #180 already finishes — see next bullet.
  - ~10%: Expansion blocked (issue tagged `needs-info` / `needs-split`). Orchestrator decision: PR slot still empty, expansion slot now free → pick up **#181** as the next-oldest unexpanded issue. (Note: #181 expansion may itself flag dependency on #180 being unblocked first.)
  - ~5%: Worker crashes or stalls → log status, next cycle re-checks.
- **2 cycles out (~20:20Z):** Likely #180 implementation in progress (draft PR opened or about to open) AND #181 expansion running in parallel (expansion slot reopens once #180's expansion completes). This is the first opportunity to use both worker slots simultaneously since the 14:30Z and 15:50Z parallel-spawn cycles.
- **3 cycles out (~20:50Z):** Likely PR for #180 ready + green → docs worker (NEW CLI flag → README update required; `Do NOT skip` per the orchestrate skill's "When Docs Update is Required" list — adding a flag is explicitly user-facing). Then testing → review → merge.
- **After #180 merges:** #181 should be `ready` by then (expansion worker for #181 will have finished). Orchestrator picks it up. Two-feature mini-cycle should complete within ~3–4 hours barring re-review rounds.

**Notes / follow-ups carried forward (cumulative):**

- **`initial_message` spawn-payload contract** stays pinned. **25 successful spawns** in a row with `{"initial_message": {"content": [{"type":"text","text":"…"}], "run": true}}`.
- **Spawn auth header:** `X-Access-Token: $OPENHANDS_API_KEY` (header name; no `Bearer` prefix).
- **Plugin spec format unchanged.**
- **Start-task POST endpoint:** `POST /api/v1/app-conversations`. Polling: `GET /api/v1/app-conversations/start-tasks/search`.
- **`GH_TOKEN` shim:** `export GH_TOKEN="${GITHUB_TOKEN:-$github_token}"` — worked again.
- **Tool install pattern this cycle:** identical to 17:48Z — `uv sync` then `uv pip install git+…/lxa.git`.
- **PR-review bot:** PR #179 was reviewed and approved between 17:55Z (impl worker exit) and 18:50Z (merge). No WORKLOG entries captured for the intervening testing/review/merge workers; the merge worker's 18:52Z commit (`18adbd5`) is the only on-disk record of the full cycle.
- **WORKLOG gap (17:55Z → 19:20Z):** Three worker conversations (testing, review, merge for PR #179) ran but did NOT append entries to WORKLOG.md. The 18:52Z merge-worker commit message documents the final state. **Carrying forward** as a soft observation — not a problem to fix yet, but worth flagging if the gap pattern repeats.
- **`ohtv ask` agent-mode family closed:** #161 ✅ (`v0.27.0`), #162 ✅ (`v0.28.0`). #173 ✅ (no version bump — internal refactor, as intended).
- **Newly-queued work:** #180 (in expansion now), #181 (queued behind #180 by 1 cycle).
- **WORKLOG truncation:** 7 consecutive cycles overdue. Same standing recommendation.

**Local checkout note:** `main` HEAD on entry at `18adbd5`. This entry commits only WORKLOG.md as `chore(worklog):`. No code branches touched by orchestrator.

EXIT per orchestrate skill — next cycle (~30 min) checks `21541ba` (expansion worker) status, looks for `ready` label on #180 + a `Technical Approach` comment, and (if ready) prioritizes + spawns impl worker while spawning parallel expansion worker for #181.

### 2026-06-04 17:55 UTC - Implementation worker (Issue #173)

Conversation: spawned by orchestrator `871fa09` at 17:48Z.

**Outcome:** ✅ Draft PR opened, CI green, flipped to ready.

- PR: [#179 — refactor: extract `_process_engagement_rows` helper from `_load_engagement_for_ids`](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/pull/179) (`Closes #173`).
- Branch: `refactor/issue-173-engagement-rows`. Commit: `ecf99c7`.
- Diff: `src/ohtv/cli.py` only, **+43 / −18 LOC** (one file changed). Helper inserted immediately above `_load_engagement_for_ids` per the technical-approach comment; chunk loop body now 4 lines (build `batch`, build `placeholders`, `conn.execute(...)`, helper call). Outer `try`/`except Exception: return engagement_map` guard preserved verbatim (never-raise contract from #167 / #168). `typing.Any` + `typing.Iterable` added to the existing import line.
- **CI:** `pytest` ✅ 1m14s · `lint` ✅ 4s · `enable-orchestrator` ✅ 3s · `pr-review` skipped while draft → triggered by ready-flip.
- **Local verification before push:**
  - `uv run pytest -q tests/unit/test_cli_gen_objs_engagement.py tests/unit/test_cli_list_engagement.py tests/unit/test_cli_engagement_display.py` → **86 passed** (includes `test_chunk_query_count` — the load-bearing 1100-ids-⇒-two-SELECTs regression).
  - `uv run pytest -q` → **2592 passed, 2 skipped, 3 xfailed** in 48s.
  - `uv run ruff check src/ohtv/cli.py` → no new errors vs. `main` baseline (164 existing errors unchanged).
- **Out-of-scope adherence:** `_load_engagement_for_conversations` untouched, JSON schema unchanged, CLI flag surface unchanged, `BATCH_SIZE = 900` verbatim, dashless ↔ dashed translation (AGENTS.md item #14) unchanged, README untouched.
- Skipped the optional `_process_engagement_rows` direct unit test per the comment's "skip unless the impl worker wants belt-and-braces" — `test_chunk_query_count` + the chunking/dashed-id tests cover the helper transitively.
- PR title is `refactor:` → release workflow will skip on merge (no version bump, no CHANGELOG entry — exactly the intent for an internal refactor).
- Ready-flip triggers `pr-review-bot`; addressing its comments (if any) is the next worker's job.

### 2026-06-04 17:48 UTC - Orchestrator

**Active Workers:**

| Conv ID | Type | Working On | Status |
|---------|------|------------|--------|
| `871fa09` | implementation | Issue #173 — refactor `_load_engagement_for_ids` | **NEW** (running, verified) |

**Step 0 — Setup:** Workspace `main` already at `f06f359` (post-17:21Z merge-worker commit; PR #178 / Issue #162 squash + `ohtv-v0.28.0` release-bot commit + worklog). `uv sync` populated `.venv/` cleanly; `ohtv` available from local checkout, `lxa` installed via `uv pip install git+…/lxa.git` (project-venv path — system-wide `--system` install still blocked by `/usr/local` perms; same pattern as last 6 cycles).

**Step 0.5 — Housekeeping:** WORKLOG.md at **1651 lines** on entry. **6th consecutive cycle** the truncation skill is overdue but the 6h-productive-window matcher continues to yield <50 lines. Same standing recommendation: a human `## INSTRUCTION: archive WORKLOG.md entries older than 10h` would unblock ~700 lines in one commit, or a fix to `/truncate-worklog`'s reverse-chrono matcher. Deferring again.

**Step 1 — Human Instructions:** None. `awk '/^\`\`\`/{f=!f;next} !f && /^## INSTRUCTION:/{print}' WORKLOG.md` → empty.

**Step 2 — Active Workers (pre-this-spawn):**
- Testing worker `56bb4b1` (spawned 16:50Z for PR #178): `execution_status=null, sandbox_status=PAUSED`, last update 17:11Z → **finished ✓** — posted ✅ PASS report on PR #178 at 17:10Z covering 11 blackbox scenarios + `2592 passed, 2 skipped, 3 xfailed`.
- Merge worker for PR #178 (logged at 17:21Z without an entry conv ID; the conv id `1cc846c` referenced from the 16:50Z entry was actually the *previous* merge worker for PR #177): `sandbox_status=PAUSED` → **finished ✓**. PR #178 squash-merged at 17:20:59Z, `ohtv-v0.28.0` released, #162 auto-closed.
- → **PR slot free**; **expansion slot free**.

**Step 3 — State gathered:**

- **Open PRs:** **0**. PR #178 merged → no in-flight work.
- **Latest release:** `ohtv-v0.28.0` (~22 min ago). Predecessors: `v0.27.0` (~1h), `v0.26.0` (~4h). Three minor bumps in a single day — the `ohtv ask` agent-mode family (#161 → v0.27.0, #162 → v0.28.0) plus a prior feature wave each triggered semantic-release on their `feat:` squash subjects.
- **Issues needing expansion (no `ready`, no `hold`):** **0**. Expansion slot has nothing to do this cycle.
- **Ready, prioritized issues:**
  - **#173** (`priority:low`) — refactor: reduce nesting in `_load_engagement_for_ids`. Fully expanded with technical-approach comment (helper signature, before/after shape, regression-test list). Pure internal refactor; the `priority:low` rating matches its scope.
- **On hold:** #26 (mcp server), #90 (`ohtv label` batch).
- **Selection:** #173 is the only ready-prioritized issue → it wins by default. The 16:50Z orchestrator predicted this exact pickup ("3 cycles out: orchestrator picks up #173").

**Step 4 — Decision (per orchestrate decision tree):**

- **PR slot:** "No open PR + ready issues with priority" → **Spawn implementation worker for #173.** ✅
- **Expansion slot:** 0 issues need expansion → **stay idle.** ✅

**Step 5 — Spawned: Implementation Worker**

- Issue: [#173 — refactor: reduce nesting in _load_engagement_for_ids](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/issues/173) (`priority:low`)
- Start task: `1cc15d90` → `app_conversation_id = 871fa09daf914f738ad1600f785aa2d4` → **READY** on the 1st poll (~5s; warm-picker).
- Conversation: [`871fa09`](https://app.all-hands.dev/conversations/871fa09daf914f738ad1600f785aa2d4)
- Verified `execution_status=running, sandbox_status=RUNNING` immediately after spawn.
- Plugin spec (unchanged, **24th successful spawn** in a row): `{"source": "github:jpshackelford/.openhands", "repo_path": "plugins/ohtv-workflow", "ref": "feat/ohtv-workflow-plugin"}`.
- Spawn payload contract (unchanged, V1): `initial_message: {content: [{type:"text", text:"…"}], run: true}`.
- Auth header: `X-Access-Token: $OPENHANDS_API_KEY`.
- **Prompt scope:** read #173 description + technical-approach comment by @jpshackelford → branch from `main` (suggested `refactor/issue-173-engagement-rows`) → extract `_process_engagement_rows(rows, normalized_to_original, engagement_map) -> None` immediately above `_load_engagement_for_ids` in `src/ohtv/cli.py` → replace the inner `for row in cur.fetchall(): …` block with a single helper call → outer `try`/`except Exception: return engagement_map` guard stays at the outer level (never-raise contract from Issues #167 / #168) → run the engagement tests first (`test_chunk_query_count` is the load-bearing 1100-ids-⇒-two-SELECTs regression), then full `uv run pytest -q` → draft PR with `Closes #173.` → CI green → flip to ready → `chore(worklog):` WORKLOG update → EXIT. **Explicit OUT-OF-SCOPE:** `_load_engagement_for_conversations` delegator, JSON schema, CLI flags, BATCH_SIZE, dashless ↔ dashed contract (AGENTS.md item #14), README (pure internal refactor with no user-visible behavior change).
- **Commit-message contract:** PR title must start with `refactor:` so the release workflow correctly skips it (no version bump, no CHANGELOG entry — exactly what we want for an internal refactor).
- **Diff-size expectation:** ~30 LOC net including the helper docstring.

**Step 6 — Quiet-cycle check:** Productive cycle (1 worker spawned). Auto-disable counter stays at **0**.

**Cycle expectations for next 1–3 cycles (~30–90 min):**

- **Next cycle (~18:20Z):** Most likely —
  - ~50%: Implementation worker `871fa09` still running. Refactor + test verification + draft-PR-to-ready dance typically takes 20–40 min; first post-spawn check often catches the worker mid-flight.
  - ~35%: Draft PR opened, CI in flight. Orchestrator waits (decision tree: "PR exists, draft, CI ..." → wait).
  - ~10%: PR ready, CI green — docs check: this is a pure internal refactor with NO user-facing surface change, so the docs-update step legitimately short-circuits ("Do NOT require docs update if only: internal refactoring (no user-facing changes)"). Orchestrator can go straight to manual testing.
  - ~5%: Worker discovers an unexpected coupling (e.g. the row-shape coercion has subtle behavior not captured in tests), reports it via WORKLOG and either delivers a tighter scope or asks for human input.
- **2 cycles out (~18:50Z):** Likely PR ready + green → orchestrator spawns **testing worker** (since this changes CLI execution paths even though the user-visible surface is unchanged — the engagement-map invariants still need an end-to-end check). Docs spot-check skipped (no docs touched).
- **3 cycles out (~19:20Z):** Likely test report posted (high confidence ✅ — the issue body is explicit that no test changes are needed and the existing suite is the load-bearing regression). Then review worker (if pr-review bot leaves any threads — likely a 🟢 verdict given the tight scope) or merge worker.
- **After #173 merges:** **Ready queue is empty.** Expansion slot also empty (0 needs-expansion issues). Orchestrator will enter the quiet-cycle window — first quiet cycle next, then auto-disable on the second consecutive quiet cycle per the orchestrate skill's auto-disable rule. Worth noting for human awareness: the workflow is approaching natural idle.

**Notes / follow-ups carried forward (cumulative):**

- **`initial_message` spawn-payload contract** stays pinned. **24 successful spawns** in a row with `{"initial_message": {"content": [{"type":"text","text":"…"}], "run": true}}`.
- **Spawn auth header:** `X-Access-Token: $OPENHANDS_API_KEY` (header name; no `Bearer` prefix).
- **Plugin spec format unchanged.**
- **Start-task POST endpoint:** `POST /api/v1/app-conversations`. Polling: `GET /api/v1/app-conversations/start-tasks/search`.
- **`GH_TOKEN` shim:** `export GH_TOKEN="${GITHUB_TOKEN:-$github_token}"` — worked again.
- **Tool install pattern this cycle:** `uv sync` populated `.venv/` on the cloned checkout cleanly (faster path); `lxa` separately installed via `uv pip install git+…/lxa.git`. System-wide `--system` install blocked by `/usr/local` perms — known.
- **PR-review bot verdict:** Two PRs in a row (#175, #178) came through with `reviewDecision=APPROVED`. The COMMENTED+🟢-tag fallback path may be falling out of use; keep checking both signals.
- **`ohtv ask` agent-mode family closed:** #161 ✅ (`v0.27.0`) and #162 ✅ (`v0.28.0`) both landed today. The dual-mode comparison instrument now exists and produces telemetry. Future `ohtv ask` A/B work has the substrate; consumer-side `ohtv telemetry list/show/replay/compare/prune` subcommands remain on the backlog per #162 Non-Goals.
- **Workflow approaching idle:** After #173 the queue dries up. Next pickup source is expansion of new issues if any get filed.
- **WORKLOG truncation:** 6 consecutive cycles overdue. Same standing recommendation — a human `## INSTRUCTION: archive WORKLOG.md entries older than 10h` is the unblock.

**Local checkout note:** `main` HEAD on entry at `f06f359`. This entry commits only WORKLOG.md as `chore(worklog):`. No code branches touched by orchestrator.

EXIT per orchestrate skill — next cycle (~30 min) checks `871fa09` (implementation worker) status, looks for a draft PR for #173 with `Closes #173.`, and (if PR is ready + CI green) routes through the post-impl decision branches.

### 2026-06-04 17:21 UTC - Merge Worker — PR #178 squash-merged

**Worker:** merge conversation for PR #178 (`feat/issue-162-telemetry`).

**Outcome:** ✅ Squash-merged at 17:20:59Z. Merge commit `0dbd6bb`. Issue #162 auto-closed at 17:21:00Z (state `CLOSED` / reason `COMPLETED`) via `Closes #162` footer.

**Merge criteria verified before action:**
- CI: all SUCCESS (`pytest`, `lint-pr-title`, both `pr-review` and `enable-orchestrator` runs).
- Review: `APPROVED` by `github-actions` (🟡 Acceptable — "Well-executed telemetry implementation with solid data structures and comprehensive testing").
- 0 unresolved review threads.
- Mergeable: `MERGEABLE` / `mergeStateStatus: CLEAN`.
- Manual test report at 17:10Z covered 11 scenarios — all PASS — plus `2592 passed, 2 skipped, 3 xfailed`. Last code commit at 16:37:06Z, so tests current.
- Docs: new `docs/reference/telemetry.md` shipped in-diff; AGENTS.md item #34 added.

**Merge mechanics:**
- `gh pr merge 178 --squash` with crafted subject + body (subject `feat(telemetry): record ohtv ask sessions to ~/.ohtv/telemetry/`).
- Body summarises schema v1 lock-ins (`agent: null` as explicit null not omission; `flags.agent_mode` mirrors `InvestigationResult.mode` from #161; ISO-with-hyphens filename grammar), env-var contracts (`OHTV_TELEMETRY_DIR`, `OHTV_TELEMETRY_ENABLED`), concurrency story (atomic `os.replace()` for blobs, sub-`PIPE_BUF` appends for `sessions.jsonl`, no file locking), graceful-degradation path, and test footprint. Closes #162.
- PR description was already comprehensive (covered every key decision and AC mapping) — no update needed before merge.

**Expected release:** `feat:` subject → minor bump per AGENTS.md "Releases & Commit Contract". `ohtv-v0.27.0` → **`ohtv-v0.28.0`** via python-semantic-release on next `main` push (~30s). The auto-generated `chore(release): ohtv 0.28.0 [skip ci]` commit and `ohtv-v0.28.0` tag should appear shortly. **NOT waiting** — release workflow handles it autonomously per #178 instructions.

**Family status:**
- `ohtv ask` agent-mode family progress: #161 (dual-mode split) merged earlier this cycle as PR #177; #162 (telemetry capture) merged now as PR #178. The comparison instrument exists — future `ohtv ask` A/B work can now produce data, not opinion.
- #173 (the unrelated refactor noted previously) is still the next pickup candidate after this family settles.

**Notes / follow-ups carried forward:**
- Per #162 Non-Goals, no `ohtv telemetry list/show/replay/compare/prune` subcommands shipped — those are a separate follow-up. Schema v1 is replay-ready (full / agent-loop / cross-mode) but the consumer side is still on the backlog.
- No remote upload path; telemetry stays under `~/.ohtv/telemetry/`. No PII scrubbing.

**Local checkout note:** `main` HEAD at `f06f359` pre-pull, now advanced past the squash. This entry commits WORKLOG.md only as `chore(worklog):` per release-workflow contract (hidden from changelog, no version bump).

EXIT per `/prepare-and-merge` skill — semantic-release is now in flight; orchestrator's next cycle will see `ohtv-v0.28.0` in the tag list.

### 2026-06-04 17:10 UTC - Testing worker (PR #178)

**Worker:** testing conversation for PR #178 (`feat/issue-162-telemetry`, HEAD `3edcaf9`).

**Verdict:** ✅ **PASS** — posted as [PR #178 comment](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/pull/178#issuecomment-4624455468).

- Setup: clean `gh repo clone` + `gh pr checkout 178` + `uv sync` in `/tmp/ohtv-test`; scratch `OHTV_DIR=/tmp/tmp.3IcIschXXh` (3 conversations / 8 embeddings via `uv run ohtv sync -n 3`); real `~/.ohtv/` untouched.
- 10 blackbox scenarios executed end-to-end through real `ohtv ask` hitting LiteLLM (`LLM_API_KEY=$LITELLM_PROXY_KEY`, `LLM_BASE_URL=$LITELLM_ENDPOINT_URL`) — no mocks: plain RAG (`agent: null`), `--agent` (`mode=cli`), `--agent-tools` (`mode=tools`), `OHTV_TELEMETRY_DIR` override, `OHTV_TELEMETRY_ENABLED=0` opt-out, graceful degradation via `chmod 555` telemetry dir (warning logged, exit 0), filename grammar regex on all 5 generated blobs, two parallel `ohtv ask` writers via `env -i ... &` (2 valid JSONL lines, 2 distinct session_ids, no torn lines), and the documented `jq` one-liner round-trips all three `agent_mode` values.
- Full unit suite: `uv run pytest -q` → **2592 passed, 2 skipped, 3 xfailed** (matches PR description baseline).
- Every documented behavior in `docs/reference/telemetry.md` verified. PR remains merge-ready (CI green, `pr-review` APPROVED, docs present, manual test now ✓).

**Exit:** Per task contract, testing worker stops here. Merge/docs spot-check are downstream orchestrator concerns.

### 2026-06-04 16:50 UTC - Orchestrator

**Active Workers:**

| Conv ID | Type | Working On | Status |
|---------|------|------------|--------|
| `56bb4b1` | testing | PR #178 — telemetry recorder manual test | **NEW** (running, verified) |

**Step 0 — Setup:** Fresh grafted clone at `d6c7248` (16:40Z impl-worker worklog commit). `uv venv` + `uv pip install git+…/lxa.git git+…/ohtv.git` inside the project venv (system-wide `--system` install blocked by `/usr/local/lib/python3.13/site-packages` perms — same finding as prior cycles).

**Step 0.5 — Housekeeping:** WORKLOG.md at **1432 lines** on entry. Oldest entry now ≈10.5h old. **Truncation still deferred** — 5th consecutive cycle the /truncate-worklog skill's 6h-productive-window matcher yields too little to be worth a separate commit. Same standing recommendation: human `## INSTRUCTION: archive WORKLOG.md entries older than 10h` would unblock ~600 lines in one shot.

**Step 1 — Human Instructions:** None. `grep -B1 -A5 "^## INSTRUCTION:" WORKLOG.md` → empty.

**Step 2 — Active Workers (pre-this-spawn):**
- Implementation worker `2a8db4a` (spawned 16:19Z for #162): `execution_status=finished, sandbox_status=RUNNING` (post-finish sandbox lag), last update 16:40:14Z → **finished ✓**. Deliverable: PR #178 (ready), commit `3edcaf9` on `feat/issue-162-telemetry`, plus `d6c7248` worklog commit on main.
- → **PR slot free**; **expansion slot free**.

**Step 3 — State gathered:**

**PR #178 — `feat(telemetry): record ohtv ask sessions to ~/.ohtv/telemetry/`** (closes #162):
- HEAD `3edcaf9`, branch `feat/issue-162-telemetry`, **ready** (not draft).
- CI: `lint` ✓, `pytest` ✓ (2592 passed / 2 skipped / 3 xfailed), `pr-review` ✓ SUCCESS, `enable-orchestrator` ✓ — **all green**.
- `reviewDecision=APPROVED` 🟢 — the pr-review bot upgraded its verdict to actual GitHub `APPROVED` state (second consecutive PR to land in this state, mirroring PR #175). Treat as merge-ready signal alongside the legacy COMMENTED+🟢 tag pattern.
- `mergeable=MERGEABLE`, `mergeStateStatus=CLEAN`.
- **Review threads:** 0 (no inline review comments).
- **Issue-style comments:** 0.
- **Docs status:** PR includes `docs/reference/telemetry.md` (new, written by impl worker) + AGENTS.md item #34 covering the schema. **Docs are present.** ✅
- **Manual test status:** **NO test report yet** — impl worker wrote `tests/unit/analysis/test_telemetry.py` + `tests/unit/test_cli_ask_telemetry.py` and they pass, but per the orchestrate skill the blackbox manual test step is a separate, required gating layer regardless of CI/review state ("The testing step is NOT skipped just because review started"). ❌ → gates merge.

**Open PRs:** 1 (#178). **Issues needing expansion:** 0. **Ready, prioritized issues** (other than in-flight #162): #173 (`priority:low`, refactor). **On hold:** #26, #90.

**Step 4 — Decision (per orchestrate decision tree):**

- **PR slot:** "PR exists, ready, CI green, docs updated, **no manual test results**" → **Spawn testing worker.** ✅
  - Re-test heuristic doesn't apply — this is the **initial** test pass, not a re-test.
  - Docs-spot-check not needed pre-test — the impl worker authored docs as part of the PR, no review-round changes to spot-check.
- **Expansion slot:** 0 issues need expansion → **stay idle.** ✅

**Step 5 — Spawned: Testing Worker**

- PR: [#178 — feat(telemetry): record ohtv ask sessions to ~/.ohtv/telemetry/](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/pull/178)
- Start task: `aed1c92d` → `app_conversation_id = 56bb4b10c0e7436dae2b14e5980daa12` → **READY** on first poll (~20s warm-picker).
- Conversation: [`56bb4b1`](https://app.all-hands.dev/conversations/56bb4b10c0e7436dae2b14e5980daa12)
- Verified `execution_status=running, sandbox_status=RUNNING` ~25s after spawn.
- Plugin spec (unchanged, **23rd successful spawn**): `{"source": "github:jpshackelford/.openhands", "repo_path": "plugins/ohtv-workflow", "ref": "feat/ohtv-workflow-plugin"}`.
- Spawn payload contract (unchanged, V1): `initial_message: {content: [{type:"text", text:"…"}], run: true}`.
- Auth header: `X-Access-Token: $OPENHANDS_API_KEY`.
- **Prompt scope:** `gh pr checkout 178` → read PR diff (focus on `telemetry.py`, `config.py`, `ask` handler try/finally, both investigator recorder kwargs, `docs/reference/telemetry.md`) → design blackbox tests against the documented schema (atomic JSON blob + `sessions.jsonl` index + schema v1 keys + both agent modes + RAG-only `agent: null` + `OHTV_TELEMETRY_DIR` redirect + `OHTV_TELEMETRY_ENABLED=0` opt-out + graceful degradation + ISO-8601-hyphen filename + concurrent-append safety) → `uv run pytest -q` for the full suite → post `## Manual Test Results` PR comment per `/manual-test` skill format → `chore(worklog):` WORKLOG update on main → EXIT. **Explicit OUT-OF-SCOPE:** review, docs spot-check, merge.
- **Sandbox creds:** Worker has `LITELLM_PROXY_KEY` + `LITELLM_ENDPOINT_URL` available for live `ohtv ask` scenarios; permitted to unit-test scenarios where end-to-end auth is unavailable as long as the test report flags which scenarios were live vs unit-tested.
- **Note on `selected_repository`:** The spawn payload's top-level `repository` field didn't carry through into the `request.selected_repository` slot (it landed as `null`), continuing a long-running pattern — all 23 spawned workers since the contract was pinned have ignored the missing `selected_repository` because `gh pr checkout` + the prompt's repo context cover the actual workflow. Filed for follow-up only if a worker ever fails because of it.

**Step 6 — Quiet-cycle check:** Productive cycle (1 worker spawned). Auto-disable counter stays at **0**.

**Cycle expectations for next 1–3 cycles (~30–90 min):**

- **Next cycle (~17:20Z):** Most likely —
  - ~60%: Testing worker `56bb4b1` still running. End-to-end `ohtv ask` exercises through both agent modes + concurrency + env-var redirect + opt-out + graceful-degradation is a non-trivial test plan (~30–60 min); first post-spawn check usually finds the worker mid-flight.
  - ~25%: Testing worker has posted a verdict (most likely ✅ pass given the impl worker reported all ACs met + 2592 tests passing).
  - ~10%: Testing worker found a real-world snag in the recorder hook (graceful-degradation path or concurrency edge), reports a partial/conditional pass with notes.
  - ~5%: Sandbox-credential issue prevents live `ohtv ask` scenarios; worker falls back to unit-only and flags it.
- **2 cycles out (~17:50Z):** Likely test report posted → orchestrator spawns merge worker for #178 (since pr-review already APPROVED and there are 0 review threads). #162 would then close on merge → `ohtv-v0.28.0` released (semantic-release minor bump from `feat(telemetry):`).
- **3 cycles out (~18:20Z):** Likely #178 merged + released → orchestrator picks up **#173** (`priority:low`, refactor — the last ready-prioritized issue). After #173 the queue dries up; expansion slot becomes the only source of new work.

**Notes / follow-ups carried forward (cumulative):**

- **`initial_message` spawn-payload contract** stays pinned. **23 successful spawns** in a row with `{"initial_message": {"content": [{"type":"text","text":"…"}], "run": true}}`.
- **Spawn auth header:** `X-Access-Token: $OPENHANDS_API_KEY`.
- **Plugin spec format unchanged.**
- **Start-task POST endpoint:** `POST /api/v1/app-conversations`. Polling: `GET /api/v1/app-conversations/start-tasks/search`.
- **`GH_TOKEN` shim:** `export GH_TOKEN="${GITHUB_TOKEN:-$github_token}"` — worked again.
- **Tool install pattern this cycle:** Fresh workspace had **no .venv yet** (different from prior cycles' `uv sync` shape). Used `uv venv` + `source .venv/bin/activate` + `uv pip install git+…/lxa.git git+…/ohtv.git`. System-wide `--system` install still blocked by perms. This is the standalone-tools fallback path; the `uv sync` path is faster when the local checkout has a usable `pyproject.toml`.
- **PR-review bot verdict:** TWO consecutive PRs (#175, #178) have come through with `reviewDecision=APPROVED` — the COMMENTED+🟢-tag fallback path may be falling out of use. Keep checking both signals.
- **`ohtv ask` agent-mode family progress:** #161 ✅ shipped as `ohtv-v0.27.0`. #162 (telemetry) → PR #178 in test gating now. #173 (refactor) queued. After #162 lands, the family closes 2/2 (plus the #173 unrelated refactor).
- **WORKLOG truncation:** 5 consecutive cycles overdue. Recommend human `## INSTRUCTION: archive WORKLOG.md entries older than 10h` (or upstream fix to `/truncate-worklog`).

**Local checkout note:** `main` HEAD on entry at `d6c7248`. This entry commits only WORKLOG.md as `chore(worklog):`. No code branches touched by orchestrator.

EXIT per orchestrate skill — next cycle (~30 min) checks `56bb4b1` (testing worker) status, looks for a `## Manual Test Results` comment on PR #178, and (if test verdict is pass + no new review threads opened in the interim) dispatches the merge worker.

### 2026-06-04 16:48 UTC - Implementation worker (Issue #162)

**Worker:** `2a8db4a` — implementation of #162 (`ohtv ask` session telemetry).

**Result:** ✅ **PR #178 opened (ready for review)** — https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/pull/178

- Branch: `feat/issue-162-telemetry`, branched off `d7dff8f` (the 15:50Z post-#161-merge tip).
- Commit `3edcaf9` — `feat(telemetry): record ohtv ask sessions to ~/.ohtv/telemetry/`.
- 10 files changed, 2092 insertions, 131 deletions.
- New files: `src/ohtv/analysis/telemetry.py`, `docs/reference/telemetry.md`, `tests/unit/analysis/test_telemetry.py`, `tests/unit/test_cli_ask_telemetry.py`. Modified: `src/ohtv/{cli.py, config.py, analysis/investigator.py, analysis/investigator_cli.py}`, `AGENTS.md`, `uv.lock` (version bump only).
- CI ✓: lint pass, pytest pass (2592 passed / 2 skipped / 3 xfailed), enable-orchestrator pass. `pr-review` skipped on draft; will fire on next push or review request.
- AGENTS.md item #34 added covering the new telemetry schema invariants.
- All ACs met (storage layout, schema v1, both agent modes, `agent: null` for plain RAG, concurrency, graceful-degradation, env-var overrides, filename grammar). Out-of-scope items (PII redaction, remote upload, `ohtv telemetry` subcommands) deliberately deferred per the issue's Non-Goals.

**Exit:** Per orchestrator contract, no further action from this worker. Docs/testing/review/merge are downstream worker concerns.

### 2026-06-04 16:19 UTC - Orchestrator

**Active Workers:**

| Conv ID | Type | Working On | Status |
|---------|------|------------|--------|
| `2a8db4a` | implementation | Issue #162 — `ohtv ask` session telemetry | **NEW** (running, verified) |

**Step 0 — Setup:** Fresh grafted clone at `d7dff8f` (15:50Z merge-worker's worklog commit, plus the fetched-shallow predecessors `3873696` / `18ac7bc` / `722ce44` / `39956b1`). `uv sync` populated `.venv/`; `lxa` installed inside the project venv via `uv pip install git+…/lxa.git`; `ohtv` came in via `uv sync`. Skipped `ohtv sync` — `gh` covers every gating signal. Discarded the `uv.lock` churn that `uv sync` emits on grafted checkouts.

**Step 0.5 — Housekeeping:** WORKLOG.md at **1335 lines** on entry (vs 1221 at 15:48Z; the 15:50Z merge worker added a 100-line entry on top). Oldest entry still **06:21Z** (≈10h old). The `/truncate-worklog` skill's 6h-productive-window matcher still keeps yielding <50 lines of archivable content. **Deferring again** — same recommendation carried forward 4 cycles now: a human `## INSTRUCTION: archive WORKLOG.md entries older than 10h` would let us reclaim ~500 lines. The skill itself needs a reverse-chrono-aware fix; that's out-of-scope for an orchestrator wake-up.

**Step 1 — Human Instructions:** None. `grep -B1 -A5 "^## INSTRUCTION:" WORKLOG.md` → empty (matches the 15:48Z, 15:18Z, 14:50Z, 14:20Z runs).

**Step 2 — Active Workers (pre-this-spawn):**
- Merge worker `1cc846c` (spawned 15:48Z): `sandbox_status=PAUSED`, last update 15:50Z — **finished ✓**, deliverable on `main` is the worklog commit `d7dff8f` + the squash-merge `722ce44` + the release-bot `18ac7bc`.
- Implementation worker `7a6ca22` (spawned 13:18Z for #161): `sandbox_status=PAUSED`, last update 13:48Z — **finished ✓** (long since superseded by PR #177's merge).
- → **PR slot free**; **expansion slot free**.

**Step 3 — State gathered:**

- **PR #177 — `feat(ask): add prompt-cookbook agent mode alongside legacy tools mode`:** ✅ **MERGED** at 15:50:19Z (squash-commit `722ce443`). Issue **#161 auto-closed** by the `Closes #161.` line. Released as **`ohtv-v0.27.0`** (semantic-release minor bump from `feat(ask):` prefix). GitHub Release published.
- **Open PRs:** 0.
- **Issues needing expansion (no `ready`, no `hold`):** 0.
- **Ready, prioritized issues:**
  - **#162** (`priority:medium`) — Capture `ohtv ask` sessions as on-disk telemetry for cross-mode comparison and replay. **Structural dep on #161 just landed in `ohtv-v0.27.0`** → fully unblocked.
  - **#173** (`priority:low`) — refactor: reduce nesting in `_load_engagement_for_ids`.
- **On hold:** #26 (mcp server), #90 (`ohtv label` batch).
- **Selection:** #162 (`medium`) > #173 (`low`) → **#162** wins. Also semantically correct: #162 is the natural follow-up to #161 (the `InvestigationResult.mode` seam #162 plugs into shipped in `ohtv-v0.27.0`), and the 15:48Z orchestrator's "next cycle expectation" cached this exact choice.

**Step 4 — Decision (per orchestrate decision tree):**

- **PR slot:** no open PR + ready issues with priorities → **Spawn implementation worker for #162.** ✅
- **Expansion slot:** 0 issues need expansion → **stay idle.** ✅

**Step 5 — Spawned: Implementation Worker**

- Issue: [#162 — Capture ohtv ask sessions as on-disk telemetry](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/issues/162) (`priority:medium`)
- Start task: `e6af3b8e` → `app_conversation_id = 2a8db4ae29ce4180a11e8399f6489dd6` → **READY** on the 3rd poll (~15s; SETTING_UP_SKILLS → STARTING_CONVERSATION → READY).
- Conversation: [`2a8db4a`](https://app.all-hands.dev/conversations/2a8db4ae29ce4180a11e8399f6489dd6)
- Verified `execution_status=running, sandbox_status=RUNNING` immediately after spawn.
- Plugin spec (unchanged, **22nd successful spawn** in a row): `{"source": "github:jpshackelford/.openhands", "repo_path": "plugins/ohtv-workflow", "ref": "feat/ohtv-workflow-plugin"}`.
- Spawn payload contract (unchanged, V1): `initial_message: {content: [{type:"text", text:"…"}], run: true}`.
- Auth header: `X-Access-Token: $OPENHANDS_API_KEY`.
- **Prompt scope:** read #162 description + comment → skim PR #177 for `InvestigationResult.mode` / `InvestigationAgent` / `InvestigationAgentCli` / `ask` handler shape → branch from `main` (HEAD `d7dff8f`) → implement per the issue comment's contract: new `src/ohtv/analysis/telemetry.py` (`SessionRecorder`, `StepRecorder`), `get_telemetry_dir()` in `config.py`, recorder kwarg into both investigators, CLI try/finally in the `ask` handler (graceful-degradation AC), atomic per-session blob + append-only `sessions.jsonl` index, `OHTV_TELEMETRY_DIR` + `OHTV_TELEMETRY_ENABLED=0` env vars, `agent: null` (not key omission) for RAG-only sessions, ISO-8601-hyphen filename grammar → tests (>80% coverage, plus concurrency + graceful-degradation cases) → lint + `uv run pytest -q` → draft PR with `Closes #162.` → CI green → flip to ready → `chore(worklog):` WORKLOG update on main → EXIT. **Explicit OUT-OF-SCOPE:** docs spot-check, testing, review, merge, `ohtv telemetry` inspection subcommand, PII redaction, remote-storage path, full vector capture in `retrieved_chunks`, any widening of `ConversationStore.update_metadata`.

**Step 6 — Quiet-cycle check:** Productive cycle (1 worker spawned). Auto-disable counter stays at **0**.

**Cycle expectations for next 1–3 cycles (~30–90 min):**

- **Next cycle (~16:49Z):** Most likely —
  - ~65%: Implementation worker `2a8db4a` still running. Telemetry recorder + both-mode wiring + concurrency tests is a moderately-sized job (~45–75 min typical); first post-spawn check usually finds the worker mid-flight.
  - ~20%: Worker has pushed an initial draft PR; CI may still be running.
  - ~10%: Worker found an edge case in the `InvestigationAgentCli` step-recording hook (the cookbook prompt's `RunOhtvTool` argv-extraction pathway is fresh as of `ohtv-v0.27.0` — minor surprises possible). Would surface as a needs-info comment on #162 or a draft-PR comment.
  - ~5%: Already in CI-green territory and ready for the docs worker.
- **2 cycles out (~17:18Z):** Likely draft PR exists for #162, in implementation finalization or CI cleanup phase.
- **3 cycles out (~17:48Z):** Likely CI-green draft → flipped to ready → docs worker dispatched (or docs-not-required if `docs/guides/search-and-ask.md` is the only doc surface — same precedent as #161/PR #177).

**Notes / follow-ups carried forward (cumulative):**

- **`initial_message` spawn-payload contract** stays pinned. **22 successful spawns** in a row with `{"initial_message": {"content": [{"type":"text","text":"…"}], "run": true}}`.
- **Spawn auth header:** `X-Access-Token: $OPENHANDS_API_KEY`.
- **Plugin spec format unchanged.**
- **Start-task POST endpoint:** `POST /api/v1/app-conversations`. Polling: `GET /api/v1/app-conversations/start-tasks/search`. Today's spawn went WORKING → SETTING_UP_SKILLS → STARTING_CONVERSATION → READY in 3 polls (~15s — warm picker again).
- **`GH_TOKEN` shim:** `export GH_TOKEN="${GITHUB_TOKEN:-$github_token}"` — worked again.
- **Tool install pattern:** `uv sync` (populates `.venv/`) → `source .venv/bin/activate` → `uv pip install git+…/lxa.git`. Fastest path in this repo.
- **`uv sync` side effect:** still touches `uv.lock` on grafted checkouts. Discarded with `git checkout -- uv.lock` before any commits.
- **PR-review bot:** APPROVED OR COMMENTED-with-tag both merge-ready (cached).
- **Review threads vs PR comments:** GraphQL `reviewThreads` is the canonical signal (cached).
- **README vs `docs/guides/` precedent:** When `docs/guides/*.md` carries the CLI flag detail and README is pitch-only, no docs-worker spawn is needed pre-test (cached from #177).
- **`ohtv ask` agent-mode family progress:** #161 ✅ shipped as `ohtv-v0.27.0` 16:00Z-ish. #162 (telemetry) → impl worker spawned this cycle. #173 (refactor) waits.
- **WORKLOG truncation:** **4 consecutive cycles overdue** on truncation. The skill's 6h-productive-window matcher hits an oldest-entry → 10h-old wall but the matcher only releases entries that are *both* older than 6h AND in the "non-productive" bucket. Recommend: human `## INSTRUCTION: archive WORKLOG.md entries older than 10h` to manually unblock, or a follow-up fix to `/truncate-worklog` that switches to a hard line-count target (e.g. trim to <500 lines, oldest-first) when the productive-window heuristic stalls.

**Local checkout note:** `main` HEAD on entry at `d7dff8f`. This entry commits only WORKLOG.md as `chore(worklog):`. No code branches touched by orchestrator.

EXIT per orchestrate skill — next cycle (~30 min) checks `2a8db4a` (implementation worker) status, looks for a new draft PR linked to #162, and verifies CI state once a PR exists.

### 2026-06-04 15:50 UTC - Merge Worker — PR #177 squash-merged

**Outcome:** ✅ **MERGED.** PR #177 (`feat(ask): add prompt-cookbook agent mode alongside legacy tools mode`) squash-merged into `main` at 15:50:19Z as merge-commit `722ce44`. Issue **#161 auto-closed** by the `Closes #161.` line in the squash body.

**Pre-merge state (verified):**
- HEAD `d80a023` (4 commits ahead of 14:38Z initial test SHA `fc4f138`).
- CI on HEAD: lint ✅, pytest ✅, pr-review ✅ (🟡 Acceptable — merge-ready), enable-orchestrator ✅.
- Re-test (15:26Z by @jpshackelford / re-testing worker `4f7e5df`): ✅ **Pass** — all 8 scenarios green including `gen objs --cache-only -F json` cache-miss → `goal: null`, `--agent` stderr notice, mutual-exclusion, allow/block-list rejection. No regressions.
- All **3 review threads RESOLVED** by review worker `a1ec2d6`.
- `mergeable=MERGEABLE`, `mergeStateStatus=CLEAN`, `isDraft=false`.

**Steps executed:**
1. `gh pr checkout 177` (HEAD `d80a023`); read full PR diff + 15:26Z re-test verdict via `gh pr view 177 --comments`.
2. **PR description updated** — converted `Fixes #161.` → `Closes #161.` (matches merge-worker task brief) and inserted a "Review round 1 follow-ups" sub-section documenting the four review commits (stderr notice, JSON `goal: null`, `COOKBOOK_EXAMPLES` extraction, `run_ohtv` docstring).
3. `gh pr merge 177 --squash --subject "feat(ask): add prompt-cookbook agent mode alongside legacy tools mode" --body-file …` — subject verbatim from PR title (per brief). Body summarises user-facing changes, architecture highlights, the four review-round follow-ups, test counts (2553 passed / 2 skipped / 3 xfailed), and the docs landing site. `Co-authored-by: openhands` preserved.
4. Verified `state=MERGED`, `mergedAt=2026-06-04T15:50:19Z`, mergeCommit `722ce443c84d1f5f0941f344af55c25b758301ce`.

**Release pipeline (kicked off automatically):**
- `release` workflow run `26963018715` started at 15:50:27Z on `main` for SHA `722ce44` → **completed ✅**.
- Tag `ohtv-v0.27.0` pushed (semantic-release picked up the `feat(ask):` prefix → minor bump from 0.26.0).
- GitHub Release **ohtv-v0.27.0** published (marked Latest).
- Release-bot commit `18ac7bc` (`chore(release): ohtv 0.27.0 [skip ci]`) pushed CHANGELOG.md + pyproject.toml + `__init__.py` version bump back to main.

**Out-of-scope (intentionally untouched per brief):**
- No re-test, docs spot-check, follow-up PRs.
- No changes to issues #162 (telemetry — depends on #161, now unblocked) or #173 (refactor) — next orchestrator cycle assesses those.
- No code pushes to main beyond this worklog commit.

**Hand-off:** Next orchestrator cycle should see PR slot **free**, expansion slot **free**, and #161 closed. #162 is now unblocked (its structural dep on the `InvestigationResult.mode` field shipped in this release). Recommend prioritising #162 (medium) over #173 (low) for the next ready-issue selection.

### 2026-06-04 15:48 UTC - Orchestrator

**Active Workers:**

| Conv ID | Type | Working On | Status |
|---------|------|------------|--------|
| `1cc846c` | merge | PR #177 — `feat(ask)` prompt-cookbook agent mode (HEAD `d80a023`) | **NEW** (running, verified) |

**Step 0 — Setup:** Fresh single-commit grafted clone at `39956b1` (15:18Z orchestrator's worklog commit). `uv sync` populated `.venv/`; `lxa` installed into the project venv via `uv pip install git+…/lxa.git`; `ohtv` came in via `uv sync`. Skipped `ohtv sync` — `gh` covers every gating signal this cycle.

**Step 0.5 — Housekeeping:** WORKLOG.md at **1221 lines** on entry (1120 at 15:18Z + the 100-line 15:18Z entry). Oldest entry still **06:21Z** (≈9.5h old). The 6h-productive-window rule still keeps yielding <50 lines of archivable content even though the file is now ~4× the soft threshold. **Deferring again** — same recommendation as the last 2 cycles: a human `## INSTRUCTION: archive WORKLOG.md entries older than 8h` would let us reclaim ~400 lines.

**Step 1 — Human Instructions:** None. `grep -B1 -A5 "^## INSTRUCTION:" WORKLOG.md` → empty.

**Step 2 — Active Workers (pre-this-spawn):**
- Re-testing worker `4f7e5df` (spawned 15:18Z): `execution_status=finished, sandbox_status=RUNNING` (post-finish lag), `updated_at=15:26:25Z` → **finished ✓** ~8 min into this cycle's window. Worker posted the re-test report at 15:26:19Z (✅ Pass verdict on HEAD `d80a023`).
- Review worker `a1ec2d6` (spawned 14:50Z): `sandbox=PAUSED` → ignored.
- → **PR slot free**; **expansion slot free**.

**Step 3 — State gathered:**

**PR #177 — `feat(ask): add prompt-cookbook agent mode alongside legacy tools mode`**:
- `headRefOid=d80a023` (unchanged since 15:18Z — re-test was read-only, no new commits).
- CI: lint ✅, pytest ✅, pr-review ✅ (🟡 Acceptable — merge-ready), enable-orchestrator ✅ — **all green, unchanged**.
- `isDraft=false`, `mergeable=MERGEABLE`, `mergeStateStatus=CLEAN`, `reviewDecision=""` (review-bot uses COMMENTED, not APPROVED).
- Review threads: **3 total, all 3 RESOLVED** ✅ (review worker `a1ec2d6` already resolved each one — unchanged since 15:18Z).
- **Re-test verdict (15:26:19Z):** ✅ **Pass** — 2508 passed / 2 skipped / 3 xfailed in `uv run pytest -q`; all 8 documented scenarios verified live; all 4 review-round changes verified (§A QA cache-only-JSON fix, §B `--agent` stderr notice, §C `COOKBOOK_EXAMPLES` refactor, §D `run_ohtv` docstring). New regression test `test_cli_gen_objs_cache_only_json.py` passes. No new regressions.
- **Docs assessment:** PR includes `docs/guides/search-and-ask.md` and `AGENTS.md` updates. Per cached precedent (logged in the 13:51Z orchestrator entry, line ~255): README is pitch-only for `ohtv ask`; the guide doc carries the CLI flag detail. **No docs spot-check needed** — the review-round changes were behavioral (stderr notice, JSON exporter, refactor) not docs-affecting.

**Open PRs:** 1 (#177). **Issues needing expansion:** 0. **Ready, prioritized issues** (other than in-flight #161): #162 (`priority:medium`, structural dep on #161 → unblocks at merge), #173 (`priority:low`, refactor). **On hold:** #26, #90.

**Step 4 — Decision (per orchestrate decision tree):**

- **PR slot:** "PR exists, ready, test results valid, good rating, docs valid" → **Spawn merge worker.** ✅ This is the decision tree's terminal merge-eligible state. All 5 gating signals (CI, mergeable, threads resolved, re-test pass, docs covered) line up.
- **Expansion slot:** 0 issues need expansion → **stay idle.** ✅

**Step 5 — Spawned: Merge Worker**

- PR: [#177 — feat(ask): add prompt-cookbook agent mode alongside legacy tools mode](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/pull/177)
- Start task: `77dcc056` → `app_conversation_id = 1cc846ccf6404636a9cf1570df07d7af` → **READY** on first poll (~25s; typical warm-picker latency).
- Conversation: [`1cc846c`](https://app.all-hands.dev/conversations/1cc846ccf6404636a9cf1570df07d7af)
- Verified `execution_status=running, sandbox_status=RUNNING` ~40s after spawn.
- Plugin spec (unchanged, **21st successful spawn**): `{"source": "github:jpshackelford/.openhands", "repo_path": "plugins/ohtv-workflow", "ref": "feat/ohtv-workflow-plugin"}`.
- Spawn payload contract (unchanged, V1): `initial_message: {content: [{type:"text", text:"…"}], run: true}`.
- Auth header: `X-Access-Token: $OPENHANDS_API_KEY`.
- **Prompt scope:** `gh pr checkout 177` → re-read full PR diff holistically + re-test report at 15:26Z → update PR description if needed (ensure "Closes #161" present + final-state summary of the 4 behavior changes) → squash-merge keeping PR title **exactly** `feat(ask): add prompt-cookbook agent mode alongside legacy tools mode` (semantic-release → minor bump → `ohtv-v0.27.0`) → verify merge state + release workflow kicks off → `chore(worklog):` WORKLOG update on main → EXIT. **Explicit OUT-OF-SCOPE:** changing the squash subject prefix, pushing code to main beyond the worklog commit, re-testing, docs spot-check.

**Step 6 — Quiet-cycle check:** Productive cycle (1 worker spawned, decision-rich gating: 5 distinct gating signals × cached precedent for docs decision). Auto-disable counter stays at **0**.

**Cycle expectations for next 1–3 cycles (~30–90 min):**

- **Next cycle (~16:18Z):** Most likely —
  - ~75%: Merge worker `1cc846c` has finished, PR #177 is **merged**, release workflow has tagged `ohtv-v0.27.0` and published the GitHub Release. #161 closed automatically by "Closes #161" in PR description. Orchestrator dispatches **implementation worker for #162** (`priority:medium`, telemetry sibling that just unblocked).
  - ~15%: Merge worker still running (squash + release-workflow push-back can take 1–2 min; on a 30-min check cadence this is rare but possible if spawn was delayed).
  - ~7%: Merge encountered a stale-branch issue (PR #176-equivalent landed externally between testing and merge — though no other PRs are open and no recent main commits other than the orchestrator's worklog, so this is unlikely).
  - ~3%: GitHub merge queue or branch protection caught something the gh API didn't surface.
- **2 cycles out (~16:48Z):** Implementation worker on #162 likely in flight (or just landed a draft PR). #162 will reuse `InvestigationResult` shape from #161, so the structural fit is direct.
- **3 cycles out (~17:18Z):** Likely #162 in CI/review phase, or — if smaller than expected — already approaching merge.

**Notes / follow-ups carried forward (cumulative):**

- **`initial_message` spawn-payload contract** stays pinned. **21 successful spawns** in a row with `{"initial_message": {"content": [{"type":"text","text":"…"}], "run": true}}`.
- **Spawn auth header:** `X-Access-Token: $OPENHANDS_API_KEY`.
- **Plugin spec format unchanged.**
- **Start-task POST endpoint:** `POST /api/v1/app-conversations`. Polling: `GET /api/v1/app-conversations/start-tasks/search`.
- **`GH_TOKEN` shim:** worked via `export GH_TOKEN="${GITHUB_TOKEN:-$github_token}"`.
- **Tool install pattern this cycle:** `uv sync` populated `.venv/` first try; then `uv pip install git+…/lxa.git` inside the activated venv. Fastest path when the project ships a `pyproject.toml` + `uv.lock` (as ohtv does). No need for the `/tmp/orch-venv` fallback this cycle.
- **`uv sync` side effect:** still touches `uv.lock` on a grafted checkout (platform-marker churn). Left uncommitted; the worklog edit is staged separately.
- **PR-review bot:** APPROVED OR COMMENTED-with-tag both merge-ready. PR #177 round-2 verdict (15:05Z): COMMENTED 🟡 Acceptable.
- **Review threads:** GraphQL `reviewThreads.totalCount` + `isResolved` is the canonical "are we done with review" signal. All 3 threads on #177 already resolved by the round-1 review worker — no extra work needed at merge time.
- **README vs `docs/guides/` precedent (re-confirmed for #177):** When `docs/guides/*.md` carries the CLI flag detail and README is pitch-only, **no docs-worker spawn is needed**. This cycle exercised that judgment for the merge decision (no docs spot-check pre-merge).
- **Re-test heuristic confirmed working as designed (re-run from 15:18Z):** the 14:50Z → 15:18Z re-test gate fired correctly (4 commits, 78 non-test LOC, user-visible behavior change) AND the re-test produced a clean Pass verdict — validating the workflow's "test what's documented" principle.
- **`ohtv ask` agent-mode family progress:** #161 (PR #177) merge-in-flight this cycle → expected merged + released as `ohtv-v0.27.0` within 1 cycle. After merge: #162 (telemetry sibling) unblocks for impl. #173 (refactor) is independent and can interleave.

**Local checkout note:** `main` HEAD on entry at `39956b1`. This entry commits only WORKLOG.md as `chore(worklog):`. No code branches touched by orchestrator.

EXIT per orchestrate skill — next cycle (~30 min) checks `1cc846c` (merge worker), PR #177 state (expect `merged`), `ohtv-v0.27.0` release on GitHub, and (if all green) dispatches an implementation worker for **#162** (priority:medium, next ready issue and the natural follow-up to #161).

### 2026-06-04 15:18 UTC - Orchestrator

**Active Workers:**

| Conv ID | Type | Working On | Status |
|---------|------|------------|--------|
| `4f7e5df` | re-testing | PR #177 — `feat(ask)` prompt-cookbook agent mode (HEAD `d80a023`) | **NEW** (running, verified) |

**Step 0 — Setup:** Workspace was a fresh single-commit grafted clone at `a2291f3` (last orchestrator's 14:50Z worklog commit). `lxa` + `ohtv` installed via `uv venv /tmp/orch-venv` + `uv pip install …` (system-wide `uv pip install --system` and `pip install --user` both blocked in this sandbox shape; venv worked first try). `lxa repo add` re-created an "Unnamed Board 1" (cosmetic, board state is sandbox-local). Skipped `ohtv sync` — `gh` covers every gating signal this cycle.

**Step 0.5 — Housekeeping:** WORKLOG.md at **1120 lines** on entry. Oldest entry is **06:21Z** (≈9h old). Per the 14:50Z note this is the **21st consecutive cycle overdue** on truncation but the 6h-productive-window rule keeps yielding <50 lines of archivable content (the file is dense with recent productive entries). **Deferring again** with the same recommendation: a human `## INSTRUCTION: archive WORKLOG.md entries older than 8h` would let us reclaim ~400 lines now that the 06:21Z–07:50Z block is solidly outside any reasonable window.

**Step 1 — Human Instructions:** None. `grep -B1 -A5 "^## INSTRUCTION:" WORKLOG.md` → empty.

**Step 2 — Active Workers (pre-this-spawn):**
- Review worker `a1ec2d6` (spawned 14:50Z): `execution_status=finished, sandbox_status=RUNNING` (post-finish lag), `updated_at=15:03:35Z` → **finished ✓** ~12 min into this cycle's window. Worker delivered 4 commits on `feat/agent-cli-mode-161` (see Step 3) + posted a "Review-round addressed" summary comment at 15:03Z.
- Testing worker `9e9d3f9` (spawned 14:20Z): `sandbox=PAUSED, exec=None` → finished long ago, ignored.
- → **PR slot free**; **expansion slot free**.

**Step 3 — State gathered:**

**PR #177 — `feat(ask): add prompt-cookbook agent mode alongside legacy tools mode`**:
- `headRefOid=d80a023` (was `fc4f138` at last test). 4 commits since 14:38Z test:
  - `090d565` — `refactor(investigator): extract COOKBOOK_EXAMPLES from COOKBOOK_PROMPT` (T2, 🟡 thread)
  - `1644059` — `docs(ohtv_runner): clarify soft-timeout semantics in run_ohtv docstring` (T3, 🟡 thread)
  - `25ef856` — `fix(cli): emit null instead of "(no goal identified)" for cache-only JSON` (**T4: NEW from QA finding** — load-bearing for cookbook agent's cache-miss detection)
  - `d80a023` — `feat(cli): add behavioural-change notice when --agent is invoked` (T1, 🟠 breaking-change thread — Option A landed)
- Files changed since last test: `src/ohtv/cli.py` (+34/-4 — user-visible behavior), `src/ohtv/analysis/investigator_cli.py` (+16/-8), `src/ohtv/analysis/ohtv_runner.py` (+12/-4), 1 new test file `tests/unit/test_cli_gen_objs_cache_only_json.py` (+223/-0), plus `tests/unit/test_cli_ask_agent_modes.py` (+34/-0). **Net non-test code: 78 lines (well above 50-line significant-change threshold).**
- CI at HEAD `d80a023`: lint ✅, pytest ✅ (15:01:45Z), pr-review ✅ (15:06:15Z), enable-orchestrator ✅ — **all green**.
- pr-review round 2 verdict (15:05:55Z): **🟡 Acceptable** — "Clean architecture with solid test coverage, but contains a semantic breaking change. None - the code quality is high, well-factored, and pragmatic". Per cached learning: COMMENTED-with-🟡 = merge-ready signal.
- Review threads: **3 total, all 3 RESOLVED** ✅ (review worker resolved each one with a commit reference reply).
- `isDraft=false`, `mergeable=MERGEABLE`, `mergeStateStatus=CLEAN`, `reviewDecision=""` (review-bot uses COMMENTED, not APPROVED).
- Manual test status: last test posted 14:38Z (✅ Pass-with-notes) against HEAD `fc4f138` → **test results outdated**.

**Open PRs:** 1 (#177). **Issues needing expansion:** 0. **Ready, prioritized issues** (other than in-flight #161): #162 (`priority:medium`, structural dep on #161), #173 (`priority:low`, refactor). **On hold:** #26, #90.

**Step 4 — Decision (per orchestrate decision tree):**

- **PR slot:** "PR exists, ready, CI green, **test results outdated**" → **Spawn re-testing worker.** ✅ The re-test heuristic clearly fires:
  - 4 commits since last test
  - 3 source files changed (excluding test files)
  - 78 lines of non-test code (above 50-line threshold)
  - User-visible CLI behavior changed (the `--agent` stderr notice in `d80a023`)
  - Load-bearing fix to JSON exporter (`25ef856` — affects cookbook agent's cache-miss detection contract)
- **Docs spot-check:** Not needed pre-merge — review changes were behavioral, not docs-affecting (the `--agent` notice is a runtime emission, not documented in README beyond the existing high-level mention). Will re-evaluate post-merge if the testing worker surfaces a docs-mismatch.
- **Merge worker:** NOT dispatched this cycle — re-test must complete first (testing gates merge, per the workflow sequence).
- **Expansion slot:** 0 issues need expansion → **stay idle.** ✅

**Step 5 — Spawned: Re-Testing Worker**

- PR: [#177 — feat(ask): add prompt-cookbook agent mode alongside legacy tools mode](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/pull/177)
- Start task: `0752ae520b194807a18f8822a2dbdd5f` → `app_conversation_id = 4f7e5df0efd34b7b9a99366ba37cc842` → **READY on 1st poll** (~5s; warm picker).
- Conversation: [`4f7e5df`](https://app.all-hands.dev/conversations/4f7e5df0efd34b7b9a99366ba37cc842)
- Verified `execution_status=running, sandbox_status=RUNNING` ~15s after READY.
- Plugin spec (unchanged, **20th successful spawn**): `{"source": "github:jpshackelford/.openhands", "repo_path": "plugins/ohtv-workflow", "ref": "feat/ohtv-workflow-plugin"}`.
- Spawn payload contract (unchanged, V1): `initial_message: {content: [{type:"text", text:"…"}], run: true}`.
- Auth header: `X-Access-Token: $OPENHANDS_API_KEY`.
- **Prompt scope:** clone + `gh pr checkout 177` → verify HEAD `d80a023` → `uv sync` → focused re-test of the 4 changed surfaces:
  - **§A `25ef856`** (load-bearing JSON exporter fix): cache-miss → `goal: null` (not the old string); cache-hit → real goal; new test file passes.
  - **§B `d80a023`** (user-visible): `--agent` emits one-line stderr notice; `--agent-tools` does NOT; no-flag does NOT.
  - **§C `090d565`** (refactor): cookbook snapshot tests pass.
  - **§D `1644059`** (docs-only): docstring spot-check.
  - Full regression sweep of all 8 documented `docs/guides/search-and-ask.md` §"Investigation Mode" scenarios.
  - Post NEW PR comment titled `## Manual Test Results for PR #177 — Re-test after Review Round 1` (do NOT edit the 14:38Z comment).
- **Explicit out-of-scope:** push code, flip draft, resolve threads (already done by review worker), run merge step, commit to WORKLOG.md.

**Step 6 — Quiet-cycle check:** Productive cycle (1 worker spawned, decision-rich gating). Auto-disable counter stays at **0**.

**Cycle expectations for next 1–3 cycles (~30–90 min):**

- **Next cycle (~15:48Z):** Most likely —
  - ~60%: Re-test worker `4f7e5df` still running. The 8-scenario sweep + full pytest on a 2586-test suite typically lands in ~15–25 min; ~30 min in, the worker is often just posting the report.
  - ~30%: Re-test posted with ✅ Pass verdict → orchestrator dispatches **merge worker** (no docs spot-check needed; the only docs change in the round was the `run_ohtv` docstring which is internal). Merge → squash with semantic subject `feat(ask): add prompt-cookbook agent mode alongside legacy tools mode` → minor bump → `ohtv-v0.27.0` release.
  - ~7%: Re-test posted with ⚠️ Pass-with-notes (small new finding) → orchestrator dispatches another review worker for the new finding; or, if the finding is trivial enough, merge worker with a follow-up issue filed.
  - ~3%: Re-test ❌ Fail → review worker round 2 (the diff would need investigation).
- **2 cycles out (~16:18Z):** Likely merge worker in flight or PR merged + release tagged. #162 unblocks at merge time.
- **3 cycles out (~16:48Z):** If merged, orchestrator picks up #162 (impl worker on the telemetry sibling) since it's the next `priority:medium` ready issue. Otherwise still in merge/release phase.

**Notes / follow-ups carried forward (cumulative):**

- **`initial_message` spawn-payload contract** stays pinned. **20 successful spawns** in a row with `{"initial_message": {"content": [{"type":"text","text":"…"}], "run": true}}`.
- **Spawn auth header:** `X-Access-Token: $OPENHANDS_API_KEY`.
- **Plugin spec format unchanged.**
- **Start-task POST endpoint:** `POST /api/v1/app-conversations`. Polling: `GET /api/v1/app-conversations/start-tasks/search`.
- **`GH_TOKEN` shim:** worked via `export GH_TOKEN="${GITHUB_TOKEN:-$github_token}"`.
- **Tool install pattern this cycle:** `uv pip install --system` blocked by `/usr/local` perms (matches prior cycles), `pip install --user` blocked ("unsupported, use a virtual environment instead"). `uv venv /tmp/orch-venv && uv pip install …` worked first try. **Cached:** when neither system nor `--user` works, fall straight to a throwaway `/tmp/` venv — fastest path on a fresh sandbox without a project `.venv`.
- **PR-review bot:** APPROVED OR COMMENTED-with-tag both merge-ready. This cycle: COMMENTED 🟡 Acceptable (round 2, after review worker's commits).
- **Review threads:** GraphQL `reviewThreads.totalCount` + `isResolved` is the canonical "are we done with review" signal. `gh pr view --comments` only shows issue-style comments (and surfaced the review-summary comment + 14:38Z test report this cycle).
- **Reverse-chrono WORKLOG.md:** newest at top, after `## Log`. Confirmed again — this entry slots in at line 4.
- **Re-test heuristic confirmed working as designed:** 4 commits, 78 non-test LOC, user-visible behavior change → re-test required. The 14:50Z orchestrator predicted this scenario explicitly (~20% likelihood); the actual outcome matched.
- **`ohtv ask` agent-mode family progress:** #161 (PR #177) in re-test this cycle. After merge, #162 (telemetry sibling) unblocks. #173 (refactor) queued after.

**Local checkout note:** `main` HEAD on entry at `a2291f3`. This entry pushes one `chore(worklog):` commit on top. No code branches touched by orchestrator.

EXIT per orchestrate skill — next cycle (~30 min) checks `4f7e5df` (re-test worker), looks for a `## Manual Test Results for PR #177 — Re-test` PR comment, and dispatches **merge worker** if verdict is ✅/⚠️.

### 2026-06-04 14:50 UTC - Orchestrator

**Active Workers:**

| Conv ID | Type | Working On | Status |
|---------|------|------------|--------|
| `a1ec2d6` | review | PR #177 — `feat(ask)` prompt-cookbook agent mode | **NEW** (running, verified) |

**Step 0 — Setup:** `lxa` + `ohtv` installed via `pip install --user` into `~/.local/bin` (`uv pip install --system` blocked by venv-required guard, no `.venv` in workspace). `lxa repo add` re-run (idempotent). `ohtv sync --since 4h --quiet` succeeded after passing `OPENHANDS_API_KEY` explicitly — `ohtv` doesn't auto-pick the secret-manager env var name unless it's already exported in the shell.

**Step 0.5 — Housekeeping:** WORKLOG.md at **1043 lines** on entry. Oldest visible entry is from 06:21Z (≈8.5h old). Same situation as the last several cycles: only 2–3 entries sit outside the 6h productive-work window, so trimming would yield <50 lines. **Deferring again** — counter at **20 consecutive cycles overdue**. Recommend a human `## INSTRUCTION: archive WORKLOG.md entries older than 8h` or a fix to the `/truncate-worklog` skill's reverse-chrono matcher.

**Step 1 — Human Instructions:** None. `awk '/^```/{f=!f;next} !f && /^## INSTRUCTION:/{print}' WORKLOG.md` → empty.

**Step 2 — Active Workers (pre-this-spawn):**
- Testing worker `9e9d3f9` (spawned 14:20Z): `execution_status=finished, sandbox_status=RUNNING` (sandbox not yet idled — typical post-finish lag). Posted `## Manual Test Results` PR comment at **14:38Z** (≈19 min run, in the predicted 15–25 min window).
- No other ohtv-repo workers active (`d09f1d5` is unrelated — different repo/task).
- → **PR slot free**; **expansion slot free**.

**Step 3 — State gathered:**
- **PR #177:** `isDraft=false`, `mergeable=MERGEABLE`, `mergeStateStatus=CLEAN`, `headRefOid=fc4f138` (unchanged since impl worker; QA didn't push code). CI: lint ✅, pytest ✅, pr-review ✅ (COMMENTED-with-tag = merge-ready signal). `reviewDecision=""` (no human approval yet).
- **Manual test verdict:** **⚠️ Pass with notes** (posted by testing worker at 14:38Z). All 7 documented test scenarios pass; 1 new actionable QA finding surfaced:
  - **Test 6 / QA Finding 4:** `gen objs --cache-only -F json` emits literal string `"(no goal identified)"` on cache miss, but cookbook prompt + docs + flag help text all promise `goal: null`. This is **load-bearing** — the cookbook agent uses `goal == null` to detect cache misses; a false-negative loop is possible. Fix is small (exporter tweak at `src/ohtv/cli.py:10263`).
  - Full unit suite: **2553 passed, 2 skipped, 3 xfailed** (matches PR description). 61 PR-new tests pass.
- **Review threads (unchanged from last cycle, all unresolved, none outdated):**
  1. 🟠 *Important* `src/ohtv/cli.py:3729` — breaking-change for `ohtv ask --agent` users (banner mitigates but doesn't eliminate). Thread ID `PRRT_kwDOR9seq86HF5Qb`.
  2. 🟡 Suggestion `src/ohtv/analysis/investigator_cli.py:57` — split `COOKBOOK_PROMPT` → `COOKBOOK_EXAMPLES`. Thread ID `PRRT_kwDOR9seq86HF5Qk`.
  3. 🟡 Suggestion `src/ohtv/analysis/ohtv_runner.py:286` — document soft-timeout limitation in `run_ohtv` docstring. Thread ID `PRRT_kwDOR9seq86HF5Qr`.
- **Open PRs:** 1 (#177). **Issues needing expansion:** 0. **Ready+prioritized issues** (other than in-flight #161): #162 (`priority:medium`, structural dep on #161), #173 (`priority:low`, refactor). **On hold:** #26, #90.

**Step 4 — Decision (per orchestrate decision tree):**
- **PR slot:** "PR exists, ready, CI green, test results valid (14:38Z > last commit 13:45Z, no commits since test), 💬 > 0" → **Spawn review worker.** ✅
- **Expansion slot:** 0 issues need expansion → **stay idle.** ✅
- **Docs spot-check:** Not needed pre-review (no review-driven docs changes yet).

**Step 5 — Spawned: Review Worker**
- PR: [#177 — feat(ask): add prompt-cookbook agent mode alongside legacy tools mode](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/pull/177)
- Start task: `6695d3ffc5ad42b49540fb9aee77d8cf` → `app_conversation_id = a1ec2d6bc6e84253b0411af720ccb41f` → **READY on 1st poll** (~5s — picker was warm from last cycle).
- Conversation: [`a1ec2d6`](https://app.all-hands.dev/conversations/a1ec2d6bc6e84253b0411af720ccb41f)
- Verified `execution_status=running, sandbox_status=RUNNING` ~5s after READY.
- Plugin spec (unchanged, **19th successful spawn**): `{"source": "github:jpshackelford/.openhands", "repo_path": "plugins/ohtv-workflow", "ref": "feat/ohtv-workflow-plugin"}`.
- Spawn payload contract (unchanged, V1): `initial_message: {content: [{type:"text", text:"…"}], run: true}`.
- Auth header: `X-Access-Token: $OPENHANDS_API_KEY`.
- **Prompt scope:** four work items — (T1) decide and address breaking-change concern with recommendation = option A (one-time stderr deprecation notice when `--agent` is invoked); (T2) accept COOKBOOK_EXAMPLES extract refactor; (T3) accept run_ohtv docstring clarification; (T4) **NEW from QA** — fix `--cache-only` JSON exporter to emit `null` instead of `"(no goal identified)"` for cache misses (+ unit test). Recommended commit breakdown listed. Explicit out-of-scope: merge, re-test, WORKLOG.md.

**Step 6 — Quiet-cycle check:** Productive cycle (1 worker spawned). Auto-disable counter stays at **0**.

**Cycle expectations for next 1–3 cycles (~30–90 min):**
- **Next cycle (~15:20Z):** Most likely —
  - ~70%: Review worker `a1ec2d6` still running. Four work items + one new unit test + per-commit CI verification is a ~20–40 min job; first cycle after spawn typically finds it mid-flight.
  - ~20%: Worker has pushed 3–4 commits, threads replied+resolved, PR flipped back to ready. Orchestrator should re-evaluate: per the decision tree, "test results outdated (code changed after last test)" → spawn **re-testing worker**. The exporter fix and the deprecation-notice changes are user-visible behavior changes; they meet the "significant code change" threshold.
  - ~10%: Worker hit a CI failure on one of the commits and is iterating to fix it.
- **2 cycles out (~15:50Z):** Either review worker still iterating (less likely past 90 min), OR re-testing worker in flight against the new HEAD. If re-test passes with the same ✅ verdict → next decision is merge.
- **3 cycles out (~16:20Z):** Merge worker in flight, or PR merged + #162 unblocked.

**Notes / follow-ups carried forward (cumulative):**
- **`initial_message` spawn-payload contract** stays pinned. **19 successful spawns** in a row.
- **Spawn auth header:** `X-Access-Token: $OPENHANDS_API_KEY`.
- **Plugin spec format unchanged.**
- **Start-task POST endpoint:** `POST /api/v1/app-conversations`. Polling: `GET /api/v1/app-conversations/start-tasks/search`.
- **GH token shim** continues to work via secret-manager env var.
- **`ohtv sync` quirk:** when invoked from a non-interactive shell, requires explicit `OPENHANDS_API_KEY="$OPENHANDS_API_KEY"` prefix even though the secret is registered — the secret-manager only auto-injects when the literal key name appears in the command. Cached for future cycles.
- **PR-review bot:** APPROVED OR COMMENTED-with-tag are both merge-ready signals.
- **Review-vs-comment surface:** `gh pr view --comments` shows issue-style comments only (returned the QA test report this cycle); `reviewThreads` via GraphQL shows inline review threads.
- **Testing-worker timing reference:** spawn → posted test report in **~19 minutes** for this 2553-test PR with 8 manual scenarios. Useful baseline for future polling windows.
- **Reverse-chrono WORKLOG.md format:** newest at top, immediately after `## Log`.
- **QA workers can surface findings beyond test pass/fail:** this cycle the testing worker found a real bug (Test 6) that the unit-test suite didn't catch because no test exercises the JSON exporter's `--cache-only` cache-miss path. Worth keeping testing worker as a required gate before review even when the unit suite is green.

**Local checkout note:** `main` HEAD at `407df00` (prior orchestrator's 14:20Z worklog commit). This entry commits only WORKLOG.md as `chore(worklog):`. No code branches touched by orchestrator.

EXIT per orchestrate skill — next cycle (~30 min) checks `a1ec2d6` (review worker), looks for new commits on `feat/agent-cli-mode-161`, and dispatches re-testing worker once PR is flipped back to ready with significant code changes.

### 2026-06-04 14:20 UTC - Orchestrator

**Active Workers:**

| Conv ID | Type | Working On | Status |
|---------|------|------------|--------|
| `9e9d3f9` | testing | PR #177 — `feat(ask)` prompt-cookbook agent mode | **NEW** (running, verified) |

**Step 0 — Setup:** Workspace already had repo cloned (grafted clone). `gh` worked with `GH_TOKEN=$GITHUB_TOKEN` shim. No `lxa`/`ohtv` install needed this cycle — every gating signal came from `gh` (PR state, CI rollup, review threads) + direct curl to OpenHands API. Skipped `ohtv sync` (cosmetic; doesn't gate decisions).

**Step 0.5 — Housekeeping:** WORKLOG.md at **958 lines** on entry, oldest entry is 06:21Z (≈8h old). Two prior orchestrators (12:50Z, 13:51Z) deferred truncation citing the "<6h productive window" rule. This cycle the situation is the same: only 1–2 entries (06:21Z, 06:48Z?) sit outside the 8h-old line, so trimming would still yield <40 lines of archived content. **Skipping again** — recommend a human `## INSTRUCTION: truncate WORKLOG.md to last 6h` or a fix to the truncate-worklog matcher that handles the new reverse-chrono layout. Counter now at **19 consecutive cycles overdue** on truncation, but the threshold-based skip is correctly conservative here; the productive entries are too recent to archive.

**Step 1 — Human Instructions:** None. `awk '/^```/{f=!f;next} !f && /^## INSTRUCTION:/{print}' WORKLOG.md` → empty.

**Step 2 — Active Workers (pre-this-spawn):**
- Impl worker `7a6ca22` (spawned 13:18Z, delivered PR #177 at 13:45Z): `execution_status=null, sandbox_status=PAUSED` → **finished** (sandbox idle, conversation closed its run loop). Title still placeholder `Conversation 7a6ca` — title-gen hasn't fired yet, normal post-finish state.
- → **PR slot free**; **expansion slot free**.

**Step 3 — State gathered:**
- **PR #177 — `feat(ask): add prompt-cookbook agent mode alongside legacy tools mode`:** `headRefName=feat/agent-cli-mode-161`, **isDraft=false**, `mergeable=MERGEABLE`, `mergeStateStatus=CLEAN`, `reviewDecision=""` (no human review yet).
  - CI rollup: lint ✅, pytest ✅ (~1m7s), pr-review **SUCCESS** (completed 13:52Z) → verdict was **COMMENTED 🟡 "Acceptable - Clean architecture with solid test coverage, but contains a subtle breaking change"**. Per cached note: COMMENTED-with-tag = merge-ready signal (same gate as APPROVED).
  - **Review threads: 3 unresolved** (none outdated):
    1. 🟠 *Important* on `src/ohtv/cli.py` — **breaking change** flagged: users with `ohtv ask --agent` scripts now get cookbook mode (was tools mode). Reviewer wants this surfaced/decided.
    2. 🟡 Suggestion on `src/ohtv/analysis/investigator_cli.py` — split the 43-line `COOKBOOK_PROMPT` constant into `COOKBOOK_EXAMPLES`.
    3. 🟡 Suggestion on `src/ohtv/analysis/ohtv_runner.py` — document the soft-timeout limitation in `run_ohtv`'s docstring.
  - Files: 14 changed — code (`investigator.py`, **new** `investigator_cli.py`, `objectives.py`, **new** `ohtv_runner.py`, `cli.py`), 6 new test files, docs (`docs/guides/search-and-ask.md`, `AGENTS.md`), `uv.lock`.
  - **README check:** README has 1 mention of `ask --agent` (line 19, generic pitch language: "Search & ask semantically via embeddings + RAG (with optional multi-step agent mode)"). No CLI flag specifics in README — those live in `docs/guides/search-and-ask.md` which was substantively updated in the PR (new "Investigation Mode" table, allow-list, browse-vs-search guidance). **Docs are in the right place; the orchestrate-skill's literal "README modified" criterion isn't satisfied but the spirit absolutely is.** Skipping docs worker — it would be a NO-OP.
  - **No manual test results.** `gh pr view --comments` returned `[]`.
  - Closes #161 (verified in PR body).
- **Open PRs:** 1 (#177).
- **Issues needing expansion:** 0.
- **Ready, prioritized issues** (other than the in-flight #161):
  - **#162** (`priority:medium`) — `ohtv ask` session telemetry; **structural dep on #161's `InvestigationResult.mode` field** → must wait for #177 to merge.
  - **#173** (`priority:low`) — refactor nesting in `_load_engagement_for_ids`.
- **On hold:** #26, #90.

**Step 4 — Decision (per orchestrate decision tree):**
- **PR slot:** "PR exists, ready, CI green, docs updated, **no manual test results**, 💬 > 0" → per the skill: "Review comments (💬 > 0) but NO manual test results → Spawn testing worker." **Testing gates review.** ✅
- **Expansion slot:** 0 issues need expansion → **stay idle.** ✅
- **Docs worker decision:** Skipped (judgment call). README updates not required — the user-facing guide `docs/guides/search-and-ask.md` was updated by the impl worker with the new dual-mode table, allow-list, and browse-vs-search guidance. README only has a generic mention of "agent mode" on line 19 and has no CLI flag detail to update. Cached as a precedent for future PRs where the impl worker correctly updates the guide and the README pitch line stays as-is.

**Step 5 — Spawned: Testing Worker (Initial)**
- PR: [#177 — feat(ask): add prompt-cookbook agent mode alongside legacy tools mode](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/pull/177)
- Start task: `4b55316a88114b57be2829c481dfce90` → `app_conversation_id = 9e9d3f9c56394cc7873c6a288c96e105` → **READY** on 4th poll (~20s; normal warm-picker latency).
- Conversation: [`9e9d3f9`](https://app.all-hands.dev/conversations/9e9d3f9c56394cc7873c6a288c96e105)
- Verified `execution_status=running, sandbox_status=RUNNING` ~5s after READY.
- Plugin spec (unchanged, **18th successful spawn**): `{"source": "github:jpshackelford/.openhands", "repo_path": "plugins/ohtv-workflow", "ref": "feat/ohtv-workflow-plugin"}`.
- Spawn payload contract (unchanged, V1): `initial_message: {content: [{type:"text", text:"…"}], run: true}`.
- Auth header: `X-Access-Token: $OPENHANDS_API_KEY`.
- **Prompt scope:** clone + `gh pr checkout 177` → `uv sync` → blackbox-test the documented dual-mode behavior from `docs/guides/search-and-ask.md` §"Investigation Mode" (8 specific test cases listed: mutual exclusion, default-mode banner, legacy-mode banner, `--max-steps 0` short-circuit, allow-list rejection observation, `gen objs --cache-only` first-class CLI flag, breaking-change visibility test, full `uv run pytest -q` sweep) → post structured `## Manual Test Results` PR comment with ✅/⚠️/❌ overall rating → EXIT. **Explicit OUT-OF-SCOPE:** addressing review feedback, pushing code, flipping PR to draft, running review/merge workflow steps.
- **Special call-out in prompt:** the 🟠 breaking-change concern from the review bot — testing worker is asked to make the new `--agent` semantics visible so the reviewer can decide if the breaking change ships as-is.

**Step 6 — Quiet-cycle check:** Productive cycle (1 worker spawned). Auto-disable counter stays at **0**.

**Cycle expectations for next 1–3 cycles (~30–90 min):**
- **Next cycle (~14:50Z):** Most likely —
  - ~60%: Testing worker `9e9d3f9` still running. The 8-test-case battery + full pytest sweep on a 2553-test suite is a ~15–25 min job; first cycle after spawn often finds it mid-flight (especially if any test reveals a real bug that needs a deeper investigation comment).
  - ~25%: Testing worker has posted a `## Manual Test Results` PR comment and exited. If verdict is ✅ Pass or ⚠️ Pass-with-notes → orchestrator dispatches **review worker** (3 review threads to address, including the 🟠 breaking-change call). If verdict is ❌ Fail → review worker still spawns, but the prompt focuses on fixing the failing test scenarios first.
  - ~10%: Worker still spinning on `uv sync` (cold venv on a fresh sandbox can take 2–3 min).
  - ~5%: Worker hit an environment issue (LLM_API_KEY missing for end-to-end `ohtv ask` tests?) and posted a partial report.
- **2 cycles out (~15:20Z):** Likely review worker in flight, addressing the 3 threads. Breaking-change decision will be the long pole — if reviewer wants `--agent` to keep meaning legacy tools (and the new mode renamed to `--agent-cli` or similar), that's a non-trivial rename across all the new tests + docs.
- **3 cycles out (~15:50Z):** Either review round 1 done (CI re-green, threads resolved, ready for re-test or merge) or — if breaking-change rename was requested — still in review.

**Notes / follow-ups carried forward (cumulative):**
- **`initial_message` spawn-payload contract** stays pinned. **18 successful spawns** in a row with `{"initial_message": {"content": [{"type":"text","text":"…"}], "run": true}}`.
- **Spawn auth header:** `X-Access-Token: $OPENHANDS_API_KEY`.
- **Plugin spec format unchanged.**
- **Start-task POST endpoint:** `POST /api/v1/app-conversations`. Polling: `GET /api/v1/app-conversations/start-tasks/search`. This cycle: 4 polls × 5s ≈ 20s to READY.
- **`GH_TOKEN` shim:** `export GH_TOKEN="${GITHUB_TOKEN:-$github_token}"` — worked again.
- **PR-review bot:** APPROVED OR COMMENTED-with-tag are both merge-ready signals. This cycle: COMMENTED 🟡 Acceptable.
- **Review threads vs PR comments:** `gh pr view --comments` returns issue-style only; use GraphQL `reviewThreads` for review threads. (3 threads on #177 not visible via `gh pr view --comments`.)
- **Reverse-chrono WORKLOG.md format:** newest entry goes at TOP (after `## Log`), old entries below. The 13:51Z orchestrator (prior cycle) confirmed this layout — `grep "^### "` returns entries in file order (newest first, NOT chronological order). Cached for future grepping.
- **Conversation `sandbox_status` semantics:** `PAUSED` + `execution_status=null` = worker finished its run loop and sandbox went idle. `RUNNING` + `execution_status=running` = live worker. Cached.
- **README vs `docs/guides/`:** When the impl worker correctly updates the guide doc (which carries CLI flag detail) and README only has a generic pitch mention, **no docs-worker spawn is needed**. This cycle exercised that judgment for PR #177; documented as precedent.
- **`ohtv ask` agent-mode family:** #161 (PR #177) → in testing this cycle. After merge, #162 (telemetry) unblocks. #173 (refactor) is independent and can interleave.

**Local checkout note:** `main` HEAD at `333f99c` (prior orchestrator's 13:51Z worklog commit). This entry commits only WORKLOG.md as `chore(worklog):`. No code branches touched by orchestrator.

EXIT per orchestrate skill — next cycle (~30 min) checks `9e9d3f9` (testing worker), looks for a `## Manual Test Results` PR comment on #177, and dispatches review worker if test verdict is in.

### 2026-06-04 13:51 UTC - Orchestrator

**Active Workers:**

| Conv ID | Type | Working On | Status |
|---------|------|------------|--------|
| `7a6ca22` | implementation | Issue #161 — `ohtv ask` agent mode → PR #177 | running (finishing) |

**Step 0 — Setup:** Tools installed via `uv tool install …/{lxa,ohtv}.git` into `~/.local/bin` (writable; `uv pip install --system` blocked by /usr/local permissions, `.venv` not present in this workspace). `lxa repo add jpshackelford/ohtv` re-run (idempotent — board already existed). `ohtv sync` skipped: cloud API returned HTTP 500 mid-page on `…/search?page_id=2200`; `gh` covers all gating signals so the failure is cosmetic.

**Step 0.5 — Housekeeping:** WORKLOG.md at **864 lines** on entry, **893** after impl worker's commit `d4aa8df`. Oldest entry is 06:21Z (7h27m old) — only 1–2 entries fall outside the 6h productive-work window (07:48Z cutoff). Truncation would yield <30 lines of trimming for ~600 lines of bookkeeping churn → **skipping again**; will revisit when oldest entry is ≥9h old (≥3+ archivable entries).

**Step 1 — Human Instructions:** None.

**Step 2 — Active Workers:**
- `7a6ca22` (impl, spawned 13:18Z): `execution_status=running, sandbox_status=RUNNING`. Worker has already delivered: PR #177 opened at 13:45Z, flipped to ready, committed worklog entry `d4aa8df` on main at 13:50Z. Sandbox still up — worker on its way to step 13 (Exit) of its prompt. → **PR slot occupied** (respect the API state; don't double-spawn).
- → **expansion slot free**, **PR slot busy**.

**Step 3 — State gathered:**
- **PR #177 — `feat(ask): add prompt-cookbook agent mode alongside legacy tools mode`:** `headRefName=feat/agent-cli-mode-161`, `isDraft=false`, `mergeable=MERGEABLE`, 1 commit (`5cbfe5a`).
  - CI: lint ✅ (3s), pytest ✅ (1m7s), enable-orchestrator ✅ (x2), **pr-review: pending** (just-triggered by the ready-flip; ~3 min in flight at observation, normal latency for a 2553-test PR).
  - Files: 14 changed — code (`investigator.py`, `investigator_cli.py`, `objectives.py`, `ohtv_runner.py`, `cli.py`), tests (8 new files), docs (`docs/guides/search-and-ask.md`, `AGENTS.md`), `uv.lock`. **README.md NOT touched** — but only L19/L67/L173 of README touch `ask`/`agent` and they're high-level pointers to the guide that *was* updated. Docs-worker likely a NO-OP next cycle.
  - Closes #161 (verified in PR body).
- **Open PRs:** 1 (#177).
- **Issues needing expansion:** 0.
- **Ready, prioritized issues** (excluding in-flight #161):
  - **#162** (`priority:medium`) — telemetry capture for `ohtv ask` sessions; **structural dependency on #161** (consumes the new `InvestigationResult.mode="cli"|"tools"` field the impl worker just added).
  - **#173** (`priority:low`) — refactor: reduce nesting in `_load_engagement_for_ids`.
- **On hold:** #26, #90.

**Step 4 — Decision (per orchestrate decision tree):**
- **PR slot:** `!CAN_SPAWN_PR_WORKER` (impl worker still running) → **Wait.** Even though PR #177 is technically eligible for the docs/test-worker phase next, racing the still-running impl worker risks branch contention or duplicate worklog commits.
- **Expansion slot:** 0 issues need expansion → **stay idle.** ✅
- **Action this cycle:** log status + exit.

**Step 5 — Spawned:** Nothing this cycle (correct — PR slot has an active worker finishing up).

**Step 6 — Quiet-cycle check:** **NOT quiet.** PR slot actively progressing (new PR #177 created within this cycle's window, CI green, pr-review running). Auto-disable counter resets/stays at **0**.

**Cycle expectations for next 1–3 cycles (~30–90 min):**
- **Next cycle (~14:21Z):** Highest probability —
  - ~70%: Worker `7a6ca22` finished, pr-review bot has rendered a verdict (APPROVED or COMMENTED). **No docs update needed** (README pointers are intact, guide already updated) → orchestrator dispatches **testing worker** for PR #177.
  - ~15%: Worker still running (rare for impl this deep past the deliverable; would suggest a hung sandbox).
  - ~10%: pr-review bot still pending (would push testing worker to the cycle after).
  - ~5%: Reviewer requested changes pre-test — would dispatch review worker instead.
- **2 cycles out (~14:51Z):** Testing worker likely posted manual-test results; pr-review verdict in.
- **3 cycles out (~15:21Z):** Review round 1 likely in progress or merge worker dispatched (if approval clean).

**Notes / follow-ups carried forward (cumulative, condensed):**
- **Tool install pattern when no `.venv`:** `uv tool install git+…` → `~/.local/bin/{lxa,ohtv}` works without sudo (`uv pip install --system` is blocked by `/usr/local` perms). Added to PATH via `export` + `~/.bashrc` append.
- **`ohtv sync` cloud API:** HTTP 500 on `…/search?page_id=2200&include_sub_conversations=true` this cycle. Not blocking — `gh` is the canonical state source for orchestration.
- **README docs heuristic for #161:** The README-touch detector (`gh pr diff … --name-only | grep -i readme`) would say "docs missing" for PR #177, but the human-judgment view is "docs updated in the right place" (`docs/guides/search-and-ask.md`). Next cycle's orchestrator: don't reflexively spawn docs worker; verify whether the existing guide update plus PR-comment trail counts as a "Documentation updated" signal first.
- **`initial_message` spawn-payload contract** still pinned (17 successful spawns). No spawn this cycle.
- **`GH_TOKEN` shim:** `export GH_TOKEN="${GITHUB_TOKEN:-$github_token}"` — worked.
- **`ohtv ask` agent-mode family progress:** #161 in flight (PR #177 ready), #162 next (telemetry sibling, depends on #161), #173 unrelated refactor (queued after #162).

**Local checkout note:** `main` HEAD pulled to `d4aa8df` (impl worker's worklog commit). This entry will commit only WORKLOG.md as `chore(worklog):`. No code branches touched by orchestrator.

EXIT per orchestrate skill — next cycle (~14:21Z) checks `7a6ca22` final status, pr-review verdict on #177, and dispatches testing worker if CI green + review verdict in.

### 2026-06-04 13:50 UTC - Implementation Worker

**PR #177 — opened (ready for review).** Issue #161 implementation pushed.

- **Issue:** [#161 — `ohtv ask`: add prompt-based agent mode alongside existing tools-based one; rename current to `--agent-tools`](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/issues/161)
- **PR:** [#177 — feat(ask): add prompt-cookbook agent mode alongside legacy tools mode](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/pull/177)
- **Branch:** `feat/agent-cli-mode-161` @ `5cbfe5a` (latest), based on `main` @ `f06f359`.
- **Closes:** #161 (via "Fixes #161" in PR body).
- **CI:** all green at promotion-to-ready — lint (3s), pytest (1m7s), enable-orchestrator (3s), pr-review skipping (will trigger on the ready transition).

**Shape of the change:** two investigation modes run side-by-side so #162 telemetry can A/B compare them before either is retired.

- `--agent` (NEW DEFAULT) → prompt-cookbook agent → `InvestigationResult.mode="cli"`. Single `run_ohtv(argv)` tool that invokes the local `ohtv` CLI in-process via Click 8.3's `CliRunner` (note: `mix_stderr=False` was removed in 8.2/8.3 — stdout/stderr are split by default).
- `--agent-tools` (RENAMED) → legacy custom-tools agent (#51) → `InvestigationResult.mode="tools"`. Unchanged behaviour, just behind a renamed flag.
- Mutually exclusive (Click `UsageError`). `--max-steps 0` short-circuits both modes to single-turn RAG.

**Allow-list for the in-process runner:** `show`, `refs`, `search`, `list`, `errors`, `gen objs`. Everything else is rejected with a structured observation naming the offending command + enumerating the allow-list so the agent can self-correct in one turn. **Block-list** (write-side commands surfaced verbatim in rejection observations): `sync`, `db scan|process|embed|migrate-cache|reset`, `fetch-loc`, `gen titles`, `gen run`, `classify`, `config`. Disjoint allow/block sets are enforced by a unit test.

**`gen objs --cache-only`** is a power-user-friendly first-class CLI flag, not a runner-only convenience: `ohtv gen objs --cache-only -F json` dumps cached objectives without firing the LLM. The runner auto-injects it on every `gen objs` invocation so the agent can never trigger fresh analyses through it. Cache miss returns an `AnalysisResult` with `analysis.goal=None`, empty lists, `cost=0.0`, `from_cache=False`.

**Tests:** 61 new (24 runner + 19 cli investigator + 9 cookbook snapshot + 2 cache-only objectives + 4 CLI flag parsing + 3 dual-mode integration). **Full suite: 2553 passed, 2 skipped, 3 xfailed** — no regressions, no test removals.

**Documentation:** `docs/guides/search-and-ask.md` §"Investigation Mode" rewritten to cover both modes + allow-list table + browse-vs-search guidance; `AGENTS.md` item #33 captures the architectural decisions for future workers (the Click 8.3 reentrancy note + `mix_stderr` gotcha is in there).

**Follow-up tracked:** Issue #162 (the telemetry hookup) is the immediate consumer of `InvestigationResult.mode`. Once it ships and gives us per-question cost/quality data, one of the two modes can be retired.

This commit is a `chore(worklog):` subject so semantic-release ignores it.


### 2026-06-04 12:51 UTC - Merge Worker

**PR #175 — merged.** Squash-merge completed at `2026-06-04T12:50:55Z`. Merge commit: `3c8c52721b4330afbc89887435d1293400fecf0f`.

- **PR:** [#175 — feat(filter): add engagement-level filters to `list` and `gen` subcommands](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/pull/175)
- **Closes:** #170 (auto-closed by merge)
- **Branch (merged):** `feat/170-engagement-filters` @ `7a067f7c8af666fee6505cfa60d786576922f4ab`
- **Squash subject (preserved verbatim from PR title):** `feat(filter): add engagement-level filters to `list` and `gen` subcommands`
- **Expected semantic-release bump:** minor → **`ohtv-v0.26.0`** (feat: with no breaking change footer).
- **Release workflow:** kicked off on `main` push at 12:50:55Z — run ID `26952816438`, status `in_progress`. Will tag + write CHANGELOG + publish GitHub Release in ~30s per the AGENTS.md release contract.
- **Engagement-metric family progress (4/4 complete on merge):** #167 done • #168 done • #169 done • **#170 → this PR → DONE.** The full surface — extraction stage (#163/#165), display column (#171), thresholds (#172), CLI filters (#170) — is now in `main`.

**Final state at merge:**
- CI: all green (lint + pytest + pr-review + enable-orchestrator).
- Review: `reviewDecision=APPROVED`, 1 review thread, 0 unresolved.
- Tests: 2 492 passing (90 new), 3 xfailed (intentional, per AGENTS.md item 30), 2 skipped.
- Docs: `README.md` (new "Engagement filtering" section), `docs/guides/analysis.md`, `docs/guides/exploration.md`, `docs/reference/cli.md` — all updated.

**Key design decision codified in the PR (per the reviewer thread):** `--min-engaged DURATION` and `--min-engagement-ratio PCT` **AND-compose** with `--engaged` (and with every other filter — `--since`, `--repo`, `--label`, `--pr`, `--action`, `--errors-only`, …). The help text on all four commands (`list`, `gen objs`, `gen titles`, `gen run`) explicitly states this. The mutex set is strict: `--engaged ⊕ --no-engaged`, and `--no-engaged ⊕ {threshold flags}` — both raise `BadParameter` (exit 2) before any DB work.

**Out of scope (deferred per the PR description, not blockers for closing #170):**
- `--max-engaged` / upper-bound filter.
- `--sort engaged` / sort key.
- Auto-running the engagement processing stage when filters are used (currently surfaces "no engagement rows" → empty result; user runs `ohtv db process all` manually).

This commit is a `chore(worklog):` subject so semantic-release ignores it — the auto-release commit for `ohtv-v0.26.0` is already in flight from the squash-merge.


### 2026-06-04 06:21 UTC - Orchestrator

**Active Workers:**
| Conv ID   | Type           | Working On                                                 | Status  |
|-----------|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------|---------|
| `3a45a77` | orchestrator   | this cycle                                                 | running |
| `062c740` | merge          | PR #171 — squash-merged at 05:53Z (release ohtv-v0.23.0)   | finished, PAUSED |
| `4f5a012` | implementation | Issue #168 — `--with-engagement` flag on `gen objs` JSON   | **NEW** (running, sandbox RUNNING) |

**Spawned: Implementation Worker for Issue #168**
- Issue: [#168 — Add engagement fields to `ohtv gen objs` JSON output](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/issues/168) (`priority:high`)
- Conversation: [`4f5a012`](https://app.all-hands.dev/conversations/4f5a012415464e67ab82a4becb70d29d)
- Start task `572378d0` → READY in 1 poll (~25s); first verification call confirmed `execution_status=running, sandbox_status=RUNNING`.

**Step 0 — Setup:** `uv sync` from `/workspace/project/ohtv` succeeded — pre-existing `.venv` from the prior orchestrator cycle was reused (no full re-install). Followed up with `uv pip install git+...lxa` to get `lxa` on PATH inside the venv. **Validated next-cycle recommendation:** the "try `uv sync` from the repo root first" pattern worked first try, no `pip install --user` fallback needed. `ohtv sync` skipped — direct `gh`/`curl` queries proved sufficient for state-gather.

**Step 0.5 — Housekeeping:** WORKLOG.md is **1729 lines** at cycle entry (>>300; **18 consecutive cycles overdue** on truncation). Deferred again — productive cycle filling the PR slot. Same recommendation: human `## INSTRUCTION: archive WORKLOG.md entries older than 12h` or `/truncate-worklog` matcher fix.

**Step 1 — Human INSTRUCTION check:** 0 unacknowledged. `awk '/^\`\`\`/{f=!f;next} !f && /^## INSTRUCTION:/{print}' WORKLOG.md` returned no headings.

**Step 2/3 — Worker status check at cycle entry:**
- `062c740` (merge PR #171): `sandbox=PAUSED, exec=null` (reaped). Per its own worklog entry at 05:53Z: squash-merge succeeded (merge commit `fe476c77`), auto-release `ohtv-v0.23.0` published at 05:56:23Z (verified this cycle via `gh release view`), Issue #167 auto-closed.
- `414d420` (re-test PR #171): `sandbox=PAUSED, exec=null` (reaped from prior cycle).
- `8be2f9e` (review PR #171): `sandbox=PAUSED, exec=null` (reaped from prior cycle).
- API search for `selected_repository=jpshackelford/ohtv` shows only `3a45a77` (this orchestrator) as `execution_status=running` at cycle entry. All previously-spawned workers are `null`/PAUSED/MISSING.
- **Both slots CLEAR at cycle entry.**

**Step 4 — State gather:**
- **Open PRs (0):** PR #171 merged. PR slot freshly empty. 🎉
- **Recent merges:** #171 (05:53Z), #166 (02:51Z), #165 (00:25Z). Three engagement-metric/list-tooling PRs landed in the last ~6h.
- **Release:** [`ohtv-v0.23.0`](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/releases/tag/ohtv-v0.23.0) published at 05:56:23Z, `isDraft=false`.
- **Issue census:**
  - **Needs expansion (no `ready`, no `hold`): 0** — **4th consecutive cycle** with the expansion queue fully exhausted. 🎉
  - **Ready + prioritized: 5** — **#168**, **#169**, **#170** (all `priority:high`), **#161**, **#162** (both `priority:medium`). #167 closed by PR #171's squash commit (verified — no longer in the open-issues list).
  - **On hold:** #26, #90.

**Step 5 — Decisions:**
- **PR slot** → Spawn **implementation worker for Issue #168** (`4f5a012`). Decision-tree row matched: *"No open PR + ready issues with priority → Spawn impl worker for highest priority ready issue"*. **#168 is the next `priority:high` in the queue** (FIFO within priority tier: #168 < #169 < #170 by issue number). Worker prompt:
  - Pinned the `--with-engagement` flag name + 5 JSON field names (`engaged_seconds`, `attention_periods`, `engagement_threshold_seconds`, `total_duration_seconds`, `engagement_ratio`) to mirror PR #165 (`show`) and PR #171 (`list`) — explicit "no new schema" requirement.
  - Pointed the worker at `_format_eng_pct`, `_engagement_ratio`, `_validate_engagement_values` in `src/ohtv/cli.py` (the post-PR-#171 DRY helpers) for reuse.
  - Required draft PR + CI green before draft→ready transition.
  - Required worklog append to `main` per the skill's commit pattern.
  - Forbade docs/test work (separate workers in later cycles).
  - Resolved any conflict between issue body and PR #171 implementation in favour of PR #171 (already merged + tested).
- **Expansion slot** → **IDLE** (5th consecutive cycle). All 7 open issues are `ready` (5) or `hold` (2). Expansion queue stays empty until the engagement-metric family closes and new issues arrive.

**Step 6 — Quiet-cycle check:** Productive cycle (1 worker spawned, PR slot freshly filled). Auto-disable counter stays at **0**.

**Cycle expectations for next 1–3 cycles (~30–90 min):**
- **Next cycle (~06:51Z):** Likely outcomes —
  - ~50%: `4f5a012` still running (impl + tests + CI cycle typically 30-60m for a flag-addition + tests of this scope; PR #171's impl worker took ~90m end-to-end).
  - ~30%: Draft PR opened, CI running — spawn nothing (PR slot occupied).
  - ~15%: PR is ready + CI green + no docs comment → spawn **docs worker**.
  - ~5%: Worker reports a blocker (e.g., engagement data not populated for test fixtures) — would re-evaluate.
  - Expansion slot stays idle.
- **2 cycles out (~07:21Z):** PR #168 likely in docs → manual test → review cycle.
- **3 cycles out (~07:51Z):** PR #168 likely approved/merging. Queue then: **#169 (high) → #170 (high) → #161 (medium) → #162 (medium)**.

**Notes / follow-ups carried forward (cumulative, lightly pruned):**
- **WORKLOG.md size: 1729 → ~1815 lines post-entry. 18 consecutive cycles overdue on truncation.** Same recommendation.
- **Tool install pattern (refined):** `uv sync` from `/workspace/project/ohtv` worked first try this cycle — `.venv` from the prior orchestrator's setup was intact. The "try `uv sync` first, fall back to `pip install --user`" pattern from last cycle's notes is now empirically validated as the operative pre-flight check. Discarded the stray `uv.lock` modification before pulling main (no actual lock churn — `uv sync` regenerated it identically).
- **`GITHUB_TOKEN` empty, `github_token` populated:** Stable for 11 consecutive cycles. `export GH_TOKEN=$github_token` shim is durable; passed through to the implementation worker prompt.
- **Engagement-metric family — 1 closed, 3 in queue:** #167 closed by PR #171's squash-merge. Active queue: **#168 (in flight) → #169 → #170**. Then medium-priority pair: #161, #162.
- **`exec=finished, sandbox=RUNNING` vs `exec=null, sandbox=PAUSED` clean-exit variants:** Both observed across cycles. Treat identically.
- **Stale-HEAD safety check pattern:** Carried forward — future merge worker prompts should continue pinning expected `headRefOid` for safety.
- **Plugin spec format:** `plugins: [{"source": "github:owner/repo", "repo_path": "...", "ref": "..."}]`. Verified by this cycle's spawn (5th successful spawn in this orchestrator instance).

**Local checkout note:** `main` at `7348e90` (tag `ohtv-v0.23.0`). `git pull --ff-only` clean (already up to date — the v0.23.0 release commit is the current HEAD). Stray `uv.lock` change from `uv sync` discarded before append. Worklog entry committed directly to `main` per skill rule.

EXIT per orchestrate skill — next cycle (~30 min) checks `4f5a012` (impl PR #168) and decides next actions (likely no spawn if still running; possibly docs worker if PR is ready + CI green).

### 2026-06-04 07:50 UTC - Orchestrator

**Active Workers (at cycle exit):**

| Conv ID   | Type  | Working On                                                | Status                    |
|-----------|-------|-----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| `0607681` | merge | PR #172 — spawned to squash, **PR was human-merged @ 07:51Z** | **NEW** (running, see note) |
| `98fabf1` | testing | PR #172 — test report posted 07:42Z                     | finished, sandbox=RUNNING |

**Step 0 — Setup:** Reused existing `.venv` from prior orchestrator cycles in `/workspace/project/ohtv`. No tool re-install needed this cycle. Direct `gh`/`curl` queries used for state-gather; `ohtv sync` skipped.

**Step 0.5 — Housekeeping (deferred again):** WORKLOG.md at 1952 lines on entry (>>300, **20 consecutive cycles overdue**). Productive cycle (worker spawned + race-resolution entry) → deferred per skill rule.

**Step 1 — Human INSTRUCTION check:** 0 unacknowledged.

**Step 2 — Slot scan at cycle entry:** All non-self workers `null`/PAUSED except `98fabf1` (testing worker from 07:20Z cycle) which was `exec=finished, sandbox=RUNNING` — terminal/clean-exit. **Both slots clear.**

**Step 3 — State gather (at 07:47Z, before the human merge):**
- **Open PRs (1 at scan time):** [PR #172](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/pull/172) — `feat: add --with-engagement flag to gen objs JSON output`. `headRefOid=cabd1775babd41867c5fc0b5efd353d7292c3209`, CI green, `mergeable=MERGEABLE`, not draft, 0 review threads.
  - 06:54Z: Docs worker `5a0f995` posted "📝 Documentation updated".
  - 06:37:51Z: `github-actions[bot]` review **🟡 Acceptable, worth merging**. Sole advisory: nesting refactor in `_load_engagement_for_ids` (deferred).
  - 07:42:55Z: Testing worker `98fabf1` posted manual test results, verdict 🟢 **Ready to merge** (8 scenarios, real DB data, exact ratio math).
- **Issue census:** Needs expansion = 0 (6th consecutive cycle), ready+prioritized = 5 (#168→PR #172, #169, #170, #161, #162), on hold = 2 (#26, #90).

**Step 4 — Decisions:**
- **PR slot** → Spawned **merge worker `0607681`** for PR #172. Decision-tree match: "PR exists, ready, test results valid, good rating, docs valid → Spawn merge worker." First spawn attempt (`9896eb0a`) ERRORED with `404 Not Found` on the sandbox runtime URL — transient infra issue. **Retried after 5s and succeeded** (`4dca60f4` → READY in 1 poll, `app_conversation_id=06076811…`, `execution_status=running`).
- **Expansion slot** → IDLE (7th consecutive cycle).

**⚠ Race condition discovered at cycle close:**

When the orchestrator did its post-spawn `git pull --ff-only origin main` for the worklog commit (at ~07:53Z), it discovered:

```
01b4e7f (HEAD -> main, origin/main, origin/HEAD) feat: add --with-engagement flag to gen objs JSON output
```

- **PR #172 was squash-merged at 2026-06-04T07:51:33Z** by `John-Mason P. Shackelford <jpshack@gmail.com>` (the human owner), **NOT** by an OpenHands worker.
- Issue #168 auto-closed at 07:51:34Z (`Fixes #168`).
- The merge happened in the ~4 minute window between state-gather (07:47Z) and the spawned merge worker's first action.
- The squash commit message is comprehensive (lifts the full PR description body into the commit body) — no Co-authored-by trailers, no openhands disclosure footer.

**Implications for spawned merge worker `0607681`:**

The worker's prompt step 1 (stale-HEAD safety check) and step 6 (squash-merge) will both find the PR in `state: MERGED, mergedAt: 2026-06-04T07:51:33Z`. The worker should detect this on its first `gh pr view 172 --json state` call. **Expected behaviour:**

- ✅ Recognise PR is already merged → skip steps 1–6 entirely.
- ✅ Proceed to step 7 (post-merge verification): confirm `ohtv-v0.24.0` published, `pyproject.toml` / `__init__.py` on `0.24.0`.
- ✅ Proceed to step 8 (file the deferred-refactor follow-up issue `refactor: reduce nesting in _load_engagement_for_ids`). This is still useful work and the worker has the full context to file it correctly.
- ✅ Proceed to step 9 (worklog append). Worker should write a clear "PR was human-merged before I started; I verified release + filed follow-up issue" entry rather than claiming the merge.
- ⚠ **Risk**: Worker may try to `gh pr merge 172 --squash` regardless. `gh` will reject (`PR not in mergeable state` / `already merged`), so no actual damage — just a noisy error. Worker should handle gracefully.

**No corrective action taken this cycle.** The orchestrate skill mandates one action per wake-up; the merge worker will discover the state itself. Worst case it exits without filing the follow-up issue — next cycle can file it.

**Step 5 — Quiet-cycle check:** Productive cycle (1 worker spawned, even though redundant). Auto-disable counter stays at **0**.

**Cycle expectations for next 1–3 cycles (~30–90 min):**
- **Next cycle (~08:20Z):** Likely outcomes —
  - ~60%: `0607681` finished (detected merge, filed follow-up issue, verified release). PR slot opens → spawn **implementation worker for #169** (next `priority:high`).
  - ~25%: `0607681` finished but did NOT file follow-up issue (got confused by merged state) → next orchestrator files it inline, then spawns impl worker for #169.
  - ~10%: `0607681` still running (verifying release, etc.).
  - ~5%: Worker errored or stuck — would investigate.
- **2 cycles out (~08:50Z):** PR #169 likely in implementation. PR slot fills.

**Notes / follow-ups carried forward (cumulative, lightly pruned):**
- **Human-merge race (new this cycle):** Owner can merge a PR while an orchestrator cycle is mid-flight. Future merge worker prompts should explicitly handle the "PR already merged" case in step 1 (treat it as a clean exit, skip to steps 7–9). The post-test-comment window (07:42Z → 07:51Z, ~9 min) is when the human is most likely to merge directly — orchestrator cycles starting in that window should consider deferring the merge spawn for ~1–2 cycles or pre-checking `state=MERGED` immediately before the spawn call.
- **Pending follow-up refactor issue:** `refactor: reduce nesting in _load_engagement_for_ids` — `_load_engagement_for_ids` has 5 levels of nesting (`try → with conn → for chunk → for row → if hasattr`); pr-review-bot suggested extracting `_process_engagement_rows`. Labels: `enhancement` + `priority:low`. If `0607681` doesn't file it, next orchestrator should.
- **Spawn 404 retry pattern (new this cycle):** Transient `404 Not Found` on sandbox agent-server `/api/conversations` POST is recoverable with a single 5s-delay retry. Worth adding to the spawn-conversation skill if it recurs.
- **WORKLOG.md size: 1952 → ~2030 lines post-entry. 20 consecutive cycles overdue on truncation.**
- **Engagement-metric family — 2 closed, 2 in queue:** PR #171 closed #167; PR #172 closed #168 (human merge). Active queue: **#169 → #170**, then medium-priority pair: #161, #162.
- **Plugin spec format unchanged:** `plugins: [{"source": "github:jpshackelford/.openhands", "repo_path": "plugins/ohtv-workflow", "ref": "feat/ohtv-workflow-plugin"}]`. 7th successful spawn in this orchestrator instance using this exact shape.
- **Stale-HEAD safety check carried forward** for future merge worker prompts.
- **Testing-worker spawn gap from prior cycle resolved:** the 07:20Z orchestrator cycle (at the top of WORKLOG.md) is what spawned `98fabf1`. Newest-entries-at-top reading-order convention re-confirmed.

**Local checkout note:** `main` at `01b4e7f` (the squash merge). `git pull --ff-only` clean. Worklog entry committed directly to `main` per skill rule.

EXIT per orchestrate skill — next cycle (~30 min) checks `0607681` (merge worker, redundant) and most likely spawns the impl worker for **#169**. The `ohtv-v0.24.0` release should be live within 30s of the merge (verify with `gh release view ohtv-v0.24.0 --repo jpshackelford/ohtv` next cycle).

### 2026-06-04 08:20 UTC - Implementation Worker (Issue #169, PR #174)

**Task:** Issue #169 - Add engagement to gen objs markdown output (below Duration). Priority: high. Predecessors PR #171 (#167, list columns) and PR #172 (#168, JSON output) already merged on main at ae22b4d.

**Branch:** feat/169-engagement-markdown from origin/main@9c92e8b.

**Implementation (3 surgical edits to src/ohtv/cli.py, ~80 LOC):**
1. New helper `_format_engaged_markdown_subbullet(engagement, duration)` next to `_format_engaged_line` - same data + precision, drops the `of <duration> total` suffix because the parent bullet already shows duration inline.
2. Hoisted the engagement batch-load out of the JSON branch in `_run_batch_objectives_analysis` so it runs ONCE before the format dispatch and attaches each row to `r["engagement"]`. Both JSON (#168) and markdown (#169) formatters now read from the same dict. Single SQL query (chunked at 900 IDs by the pre-existing `_load_engagement_for_ids`).
3. `_format_summary_markdown` reads `r.get("engagement")` / `r.get("duration")` and inserts the `Engaged:` sub-bullet between the parent bullet and the existing refs / labels. Public signature `(results, *, include_outputs)` unchanged.
4. Updated `--with-engagement` help text to mention the markdown rendering effect.

**Tests:** New file `tests/unit/test_cli_gen_objs_engagement_markdown.py` - 29 tests covering helper (12) + formatter integration (8) + CLI via CliRunner (6) + help-text surface (1) + signature-stability regression (1) + ID-normalization (dashed caller, dashless DB row). All AC bullets from the issue have a corresponding test.

**Verification:**
- `uv run pytest tests/unit -q` -> 2353 passed, 2 skipped, 3 xfailed (38s). Zero regressions in the existing 86 engagement-stage tests (test_cli_engagement_display.py, test_cli_list_engagement.py, test_cli_gen_objs_engagement.py).
- `uv run ruff check src tests` -> 168 errors total, identical to main (verified with git stash round-trip). Zero new lint errors in my changes.
- CI on PR #174: lint pass 5s, pytest pass 1m5s, enable-orchestrator pass 2s, pr-review skipping (will run on ready). All green at 08:18Z.

**PR:** [#174](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/pull/174) - `feat: add engagement to gen objs markdown output`. Opened as draft, flipped to ready-for-review at 08:19Z (triggers pr-review bot). `Fixes #169` in description. Title is a valid Conventional-Commit subject so the python-semantic-release squash flow will minor-bump on merge.

**Out-of-scope (honored per orchestrator brief):**
- #173 (refactor `_load_engagement_for_ids` nesting) - separate issue, not in this PR.
- Docs update - docs worker will handle after CI green.
- Default-on `--with-engagement` - explicit follow-up once metric beds in (matches #167 / #168 rationale).

**Worker exits.** Docs / review / QA / merge are separate orchestrator-spawned conversations.

### 2026-06-04 10:20 UTC - Orchestrator

**Active Workers:**

| Conv ID | Type | Working On | Status |
|---------|------|------------|--------|
| `002934f` | merge | PR #174 — squash-merge | **NEW** (running, first poll) |

**Step 0 — Setup:** `uv venv .venv` + `uv pip install lxa ohtv` (system Python `site-packages` is read-only this cycle). `lxa repo add` was idempotent. `ohtv sync` skipped (this cycle is merge-gated, not data-gated).

**Step 0.5 — Housekeeping:** ✅ **Worklog truncated.** Was 2464 lines (24th consecutive overdue cycle); now **943 lines** before this entry. Kept 19 entries spanning the 6-hour productive window (cutoff `2026-06-04 03:55Z`). 26 entries archived to `WORKLOG_ARCHIVE_2026-05-30.md` (+1), `…_2026-06-02.md` (+8), `…_2026-06-03.md` (+6), `…_2026-06-04.md` (+11). Productive-anchor algorithm (`/truncate-worklog`) worked exactly as designed.

**Step 1 — Human Instructions:** None pending.

**Step 2 — Active Workers (pre-this-spawn):** Previous cycle's testing worker `84a32f4` reports `execution_status=finished`. PR slot is **free**. Expansion slot has been idle for multiple cycles.

**Step 3 — State gathered:**
- **Open PRs:** [#174](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/pull/174) — `feat: add engagement to gen objs markdown output` (closes #169), ready, branch `feat/169-engagement-markdown`.
- **PR #174 status (lxa-style):** `oAFc green ready` — `o`pened, **A**pproved (github-actions bot, 08:33Z), `F`ixes pushed (docs commit `4ba37ec` at 09:25Z), CI green (`lint` + `pytest` both SUCCESS), no unresolved review threads, `💬 0` from humans, manual test report posted at 09:58Z by `84a32f4` (verdict **ALL TESTS PASS** — 2353 passed). **Merge criteria met.**
- **Issues needing expansion:** 0 (all open issues already carry `ready`).
- **Ready issues (5):** #169 (priority:high, *merging now*), #170 (priority:high), #161 (priority:medium), #162 (priority:medium), #173 (priority:low).

**Step 4 — Decision (per orchestrate decision tree):**
- PR slot: `PR exists, ready, CI green, docs updated, test results valid, good rating, docs valid` → **Spawn merge worker.** ✅
- Expansion slot: no issues need expansion → **stay idle.** ✅

**Step 5 — Spawned: Merge Worker**
- PR: [#174 — feat: add engagement to gen objs markdown output](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/pull/174) (closes #169)
- Start task: `b6921de6` → `app_conversation_id = 002934fe65ca48d4b8e483814350dbd8`
- Conversation: [`002934f`](https://app.all-hands.dev/conversations/002934fe65ca48d4b8e483814350dbd8)
- Polling timeline: `SETTING_UP_SKILLS` (T+0s) → `STARTING_CONVERSATION` (T+5s) → `READY` (T+10s). First-attempt success, single-cycle spawn.
- Verify (T+~15s): `execution_status=running`, `sandbox_status=RUNNING`. **Confirmed actually executing.**
- Plugin spec (unchanged, 12th successful spawn): `{"source": "github:jpshackelford/.openhands", "repo_path": "plugins/ohtv-workflow", "ref": "feat/ohtv-workflow-plugin"}`.
- Spawn payload contract: `initial_message: {content: [{type:"text", text:"…"}], run: true}` (V1 — verified yet again).
- Prompt scope: holistic PR-diff review → update PR description → conventional-commit squash subject `feat: add engagement to gen objs markdown output (#169)` → `gh pr merge 174 --squash --subject … --body …` → verify merged → append WORKLOG.md merge entry on `main` → EXIT.

**Step 6 — Quiet-cycle check:** Productive cycle (1 worker spawned + worklog truncated). Auto-disable counter resets to **0**.

**Cycle expectations for next 1–3 cycles (~30–90 min):**
- **Next cycle (~10:50Z):** Most likely —
  - ~80%: `002934f` finished, PR #174 squash-merged with `feat:` subject → release workflow runs → new tag (`ohtv-vX.(Y+1).0`) → CHANGELOG entry. PR slot opens. → Spawn **implementation worker for #170** (`Filter conversations by engagement level`, priority:high, the next engagement-family issue).
  - ~15%: Merge worker still running (PR description rewrite + squash takes time).
  - ~5%: Merge worker hits an unexpected branch-protection or status mismatch and posts a comment instead of merging. (`statusCheckRollup` shows both SUCCESS, so unlikely, but `gh pr view --json mergeable,mergeStateStatus` did return `UNKNOWN/UNKNOWN` at check time — likely GitHub-side cache lag.)
- **2 cycles out (~11:20Z):** Implementation worker for #170 underway; expansion slot still idle.
- **3 cycles out (~11:50Z):** PR #175 (for #170) likely in draft or moving to ready.

**Notes / follow-ups carried forward (cumulative):**
- **`initial_message` spawn-payload contract** remains the high-priority pin (since 09:23Z diagnosis). 12 successful spawns in a row using `{"initial_message": {"content": [{"type":"text","text":"…"}], "run": true}}`. Never use the deprecated `initial_user_msg`.
- **Spawn auth header:** `X-Access-Token: $OPENHANDS_API_KEY` (the `/spawn-conversation` skill's documented header). Other endpoints accept `Authorization: Bearer …` — both work against the same key.
- **OpenHands Cloud API gotchas (still relevant):** `POST /api/v1/app-conversations` (no trailing slash); `start-tasks/search` returns `{"items": […]}`; poll start-task by `id` from the POST response, not by conv id.
- **Tool install pattern:** system Python `site-packages` was read-only this cycle — fell back to `uv venv .venv` + `uv pip install …`. Adds ~5s overhead but no behavior change. The `which lxa || install` guard still does the right thing.
- **Engagement-metric family progress:** #167 ✅ merged, #168 ✅ merged, **#169 → PR #174 merge in flight this cycle**, #170 next. After merge, **2/4 → 3/4 done.**
- **GitHub CLI:** `--json reviewThreads` is NOT a valid field on `gh pr view`. Use GraphQL (`pullRequest.reviewThreads`) for thread visibility. Cached.
- **`gh pr view --json mergeable,mergeStateStatus` returned `UNKNOWN/UNKNOWN`** even though `statusCheckRollup` showed both checks SUCCESS — likely a GitHub-side cache lag. **The `statusCheckRollup` is the source of truth for "is CI green?".** Cached.
- **`GITHUB_TOKEN` populated this cycle.** Shim `GH_TOKEN=${GITHUB_TOKEN:-$github_token}` still in carry-forward.
- **Plugin spec format unchanged:** 12th successful spawn.

**Local checkout note:** `main` HEAD at `aff3f9f` on entry; will advance with the worklog-truncation commit (archive files + truncated WORKLOG.md) plus this entry. No code branches created by orchestrator.

EXIT per orchestrate skill — next cycle (~30 min) checks `002934f` (merge worker) and, if PR #174 is merged, spawns the implementation worker for **#170** (`Filter conversations by engagement level`, priority:high).

### 2026-06-04 10:22 UTC - Merge Worker (PR #174)

✅ **Squash-merged PR #174 — `feat: add engagement to gen objs markdown output (#169)`.**

- Conv ID: `002934f` (this conversation)
- PR: [#174](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/pull/174) → state `MERGED`, merged at `2026-06-04T10:22:23Z`
- Merge commit: [`f140744`](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/commit/f140744e5199f30f94d326a0dfbc19c746941a2d)
- Closes: [#169 — Add engagement to `gen objs` markdown output (below Duration)](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/issues/169)
- Branch deleted by `gh pr merge --squash` (default).

**What shipped (holistic diff review):**
- `_format_engaged_markdown_subbullet` helper in `src/ohtv/cli.py` — mirrors `_format_engaged_line` precision (`XX.X%`) and grammar (singular `period` / plural `periods`) but drops the redundant `of <duration> total` suffix since the parent bullet already shows duration inline. Returns `None` on missing rows so the caller can silently omit the sub-bullet.
- `_run_batch_objectives_analysis` now batch-loads engagement rows **once** before format dispatch, then attaches `r["engagement"]` for both the JSON formatter (#168) and the markdown formatter (#169). Consolidates the prior #168-only load — single SQL query (chunked at 900 IDs by `_load_engagement_for_ids`), no N+1 in either format path.
- `_format_summary_markdown` reads `r.get("engagement")` / `r.get("duration")` and renders `  - Engaged: <duration> in N period[s] (X.X%)` between the parent bullet and the existing refs / labels sub-bullets. Public signature `(results, *, include_outputs)` unchanged — regression-tested.
- `--with-engagement` help text updated to mention both `-F markdown` and `-F json` effects.
- Docs touched: `docs/guides/analysis.md` (3 examples updated), `docs/reference/cli.md` (one help-text row).

**Key decisions (recorded for future readers):**
1. **Silent omission on missing rows.** Returns `None` from the helper and the caller skips the sub-bullet; no `Engaged: -` placeholder. Matches the AC and parallels the `_format_engaged_line` zero-duration handling.
2. **Singular/plural grammar.** `1 period` vs `N periods` — covered by an explicit helper test (`test_singular_period`). No `1 periods` ever.
3. **Percentage uses event-window duration, not `total_duration_seconds`.** The `(X.X%)` parenthetical divides by `r["duration"]` (carried on the result from the event window) rather than the engagement row's stored total. End-to-end flow keeps these identical; only synthetic seeding (as in the manual blackbox test) can drift them. Documented inline in the source comment and called out in the manual test report.

**Test coverage:**
- 29 new unit tests in `tests/unit/test_cli_gen_objs_engagement_markdown.py` (helper + formatter + CLI + help-text + signature-stability).
- Total: 2353 unit tests pass (2 skipped, 3 xfailed — the cloud-sync behavioral harness xfails per AGENTS.md "Testing" section).
- Manual blackbox: **15/15 scenarios pass** — comment [#4621055211](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/pull/174#issuecomment-4621055211). Highlights: byte-stable diff vs. flag-off (only the three new `Engaged:` lines differ), sub-bullet ordering before refs/labels, indentation parity, table-format no-op confirmed, JSON flag (#172) unaffected.

**PR description updated** prior to merge: appended a `## Verification (final state)` section linking the manual test comment, the CI status, and the review decision; added a `## Percentage derivation note` paragraph clarifying the `r["duration"]` vs `total_duration_seconds` distinction for future readers tripping over `>100%` values in synthetic test fixtures.

**Squash subject** (release-workflow-visible): `feat: add engagement to gen objs markdown output (#169)`. Per AGENTS.md "Releases & Commit Contract", this is a `feat:` subject → triggers a **minor version bump** and a new `Features` section in `CHANGELOG.md` on the next release-workflow run on `main` (expected within ~30s of this merge commit hitting `main`). Tag to watch: `ohtv-v0.25.0`.

**Engagement-metric family progress:**
- #167 ✅ merged (engagement processing stage + DB column)
- #168 ✅ merged (`--with-engagement` JSON output via PR #172)
- **#169 ✅ merged now (this PR — markdown sub-bullet)**
- #170 → next implementation target (`priority:high`, `ready`, expanded body — `Filter conversations by engagement level` via `--engaged` / `--min-engaged` / `--min-engagement-ratio`)

**Follow-ups noted in PR body (out of scope for #169):**
- #173 — refactor `_load_engagement_for_ids` for shared use (engagement family + future callers).
- Default-on `--with-engagement` — explicit follow-up once the metric beds in. Matches the rationale in #167 / #168.
- Schema-driven engagement column in `-F table` — explicit follow-up.

**Exit:** Merge worker done. Orchestrator's next cycle will pick up #170 implementation per the engagement-metric family progression.

### 2026-06-04 10:50 UTC - Orchestrator

**Active Workers:**

| Conv ID | Type | Working On | Status |
|---------|------|------------|--------|
| `1f83ee2` | implementation | Issue #170 — engagement filters | **NEW** (running, first poll) |

**Step 0 — Setup:** `uv tool install` for `lxa` + `ohtv` (system `site-packages` read-only again — same pattern as 10:20Z cycle, just used `uv tool install` instead of `uv venv` this time, equivalent outcome). `lxa repo add` idempotent. `ohtv sync` ran clean (no output).

**Step 0.5 — Housekeeping:** WORKLOG.md is **1055 lines** at cycle entry. Just truncated last cycle (10:20Z dropped from 2464 → 943). Productive cycle (1 worker spawned). **Defer truncation** — next cutoff will naturally drop the 10:20Z entry once it ages past the 6h window. Counter reset to "0 cycles overdue" after the 10:20Z truncation.

**Step 1 — Human Instructions:** None pending. `awk` over WORKLOG.md (excluding fenced code blocks) for `^## INSTRUCTION:` → empty.

**Step 2 — Active Workers (pre-this-spawn):** Prior cycle's merge worker `002934f` is `execution_status=null, sandbox_status=PAUSED` → **finished**. PR slot is **free**. Expansion slot has been idle for many cycles.

**Step 3 — State gathered:**
- **PR #174 — MERGED at 2026-06-04T10:22:23Z** (squash commit `f140744`). Closed Issue #169. **Engagement-metric family progress: 3/4 done** (#167 ✅, #168 ✅, #169 ✅, #170 next).
- **Release: `ohtv-v0.25.0` tagged** (auto-release ran on the squash-merge subject `feat: add engagement to gen objs markdown output (#169)`). `main` at `5124eec` (chore(release): ohtv 0.25.0 [skip ci]).
- **Open PRs:** 0. PR slot fully open.
- **Issues needing expansion:** 0 (`{ready, hold}` ∪ closed covers all 6 open issues).
- **Ready issues (4):**
  - **#170** — priority:**high** — Filter conversations by engagement level (`--engaged`, `--min-engaged`) ⬅ picked
  - #161 — priority:medium — `ohtv ask`: prompt-based agent mode + `--agent-tools` rename
  - #162 — priority:medium — Capture `ohtv ask` sessions as on-disk telemetry
  - #173 — priority:low — refactor: reduce nesting in `_load_engagement_for_ids`
- **On hold (2):** #26 (mcp server), #90 (`ohtv label` batch).

**Step 4 — Decision (per orchestrate decision tree):**
- PR slot: `No open PR + ready issues with priority` → **Spawn implementation worker for highest priority (#170, priority:high).** ✅
- Expansion slot: 0 issues need expansion → **stay idle.** ✅

**Step 5 — Spawned: Implementation Worker**
- Issue: [#170 — Filter conversations by engagement level](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/issues/170) (priority:high)
- Start task: `08cc30b0` → `app_conversation_id = 1f83ee25fdc14a199f89b53e96bf138e`
- Conversation: [`1f83ee2`](https://app.all-hands.dev/conversations/1f83ee25fdc14a199f89b53e96bf138e)
- Polling timeline: `WORKING` (T+0s) → `READY` (T+5s). **Fastest spawn-task transition observed this run — single 5s poll.** First-attempt success.
- Verify (T+13s): `execution_status=running`, `sandbox_status=RUNNING`. ✅ Confirmed executing.
- Plugin spec (unchanged, **13th successful spawn**): `{"source": "github:jpshackelford/.openhands", "repo_path": "plugins/ohtv-workflow", "ref": "feat/ohtv-workflow-plugin"}`.
- Spawn payload contract: `initial_message: {content: [{type:"text", text:"…"}], run: true}` (V1 — verified yet again, 13th in a row).
- Auth header: `X-Access-Token: $OPENHANDS_API_KEY` (per `/spawn-conversation` skill).
- Prompt scope: read issue body & comments → branch `feat/170-engagement-filters` from `origin/main` (now at 5124eec, post-#174-release) → implement `parse_duration_to_seconds` + `_filter_by_engagement` reusing PR #171's batched `_load_engagement_for_conversations` → wire `--engaged` / `--no-engaged` / `--min-engaged DURATION` / `--min-engagement-ratio PCT` into `_apply_conversation_filters` (covers `list`, `gen objs`, `gen titles`, `gen run` in one shot) → mutual-exclusion validation → tests per the issue's enumerated AC list → draft PR with `Closes #170` → CI green → ready → WORKLOG entry → EXIT.

**Step 6 — Quiet-cycle check:** Productive cycle (1 worker spawned + PR #174 merge confirmed + release recorded). Auto-disable counter stays at **0**.

**Cycle expectations for next 1–3 cycles (~30–90 min):**
- **Next cycle (~11:20Z):** Most likely —
  - ~55%: Implementation worker `1f83ee2` still running. The #170 surface area is non-trivial (4 flags × 4 commands × mutual-exclusion + duration parser + missing-row semantics + ~12 test cases). Expect 30–75 min of real work.
  - ~30%: Worker finished with a draft PR #175 pushed; CI may or may not be green yet. → Wait (PR worker is the implementation worker still finalizing) OR spawn nothing if PR is ready+green.
  - ~10%: Worker finished, PR ready, CI green, **README not updated** → spawn **docs worker** (high priority — #170 adds 4 new CLI flags × 4 commands = the canonical "user-facing change" trigger).
  - ~5%: Worker hit an unexpected blocker.
- **2 cycles out (~11:50Z):** Most likely PR #175 in the docs → testing pipeline.
- **3 cycles out (~12:20Z):** Testing landed; review or merge in flight; #170 close to merge → engagement family **4/4 done** 🎉.

**Notes / follow-ups carried forward (cumulative):**
- **`initial_message` spawn-payload contract** remains the high-priority pin. **13 successful spawns** in a row with `{"initial_message": {"content": [{"type":"text","text":"…"}], "run": true}}`. Deprecated `initial_user_msg` still never used.
- **Spawn auth header:** `X-Access-Token: $OPENHANDS_API_KEY` (the `/spawn-conversation` skill's documented header). Other endpoints accept `Authorization: Bearer …` — both work against the same key.
- **OpenHands Cloud API gotchas:** `POST /api/v1/app-conversations` (no trailing slash); `start-tasks/search` returns `{"items": […]}`; poll start-task by `id` from the POST response.
- **Tool install pattern:** `uv tool install git+https://github.com/jpshackelford/lxa.git` + same for `ohtv` works cleanly when `site-packages` is read-only — adds `/home/openhands/.local/bin` to PATH. Either `uv venv .venv` (10:20Z) or `uv tool install` (this cycle) gets it done; tool install is slightly cleaner because no venv to source.
- **Engagement-metric family progress: 3/4 done** after this cycle's merge confirmation. #170 implementation in flight → expect 4/4 within 2–3 cycles. Then #161/#162/#173 take over the ready queue.
- **GitHub CLI `--json merged` is not a field.** Use `state == "MERGED"` (and `mergedAt`, `mergeCommit`) instead. Cached.
- **`GH_TOKEN` vs `github_token`:** `GH_TOKEN` was unset, `github_token` was the populated one. `export GH_TOKEN="$github_token"` works. (Inverse of the 10:20Z cycle's "GITHUB_TOKEN populated" note — the available shim flips between cycles; check both.)
- **Release workflow confirmation:** `feat:` squash-merge subject for PR #174 triggered `ohtv-v0.25.0` tag as designed. End-to-end ~2 min from merge to tagged release. No manual intervention.
- **`statusCheckRollup` is the source of truth for "is CI green?"** — `mergeable`/`mergeStateStatus` may show `UNKNOWN` due to GitHub-side cache lag (observed in 10:20Z cycle; not re-triggered this cycle since the PR is now closed).
- **Plugin spec format unchanged:** 13th successful spawn — `{"source": "github:jpshackelford/.openhands", "repo_path": "plugins/ohtv-workflow", "ref": "feat/ohtv-workflow-plugin"}`.

**Local checkout note:** `main` HEAD at `5124eec` on entry (ohtv-v0.25.0 release commit). This entry pushes one more commit on top. No code branches created by the orchestrator — implementation worker `1f83ee2` will create `feat/170-engagement-filters` in its own sandbox.

EXIT per orchestrate skill — next cycle (~30 min) checks `1f83ee2` (implementation worker) and any draft/ready PR #175 it has pushed.

### 2026-06-04 11:20 UTC - Orchestrator

**Active Workers:**

| Conv ID | Type | Working On | Status |
|---------|------|------------|--------|
| `ee9bfd9` | docs | PR #175 — README for engagement filters | **NEW** (running, first poll) |

**Step 0 — Setup:** `uv sync` ran clean in the local checkout (fresh `.venv` since the cloned workspace had no env). `lxa` + `ohtv` resolved from `.venv/bin/`. `lxa repo add jpshackelford/ohtv` was a fresh add (created `Unnamed Board 1` — cosmetic, no behavior impact). `ohtv sync` was slow this cycle (>30s, did not gate any decision) — skipped output; subsequent `gh`/`lxa` calls did all the gating.

**Step 0.5 — Housekeeping:** WORKLOG.md is **1176 lines** at cycle entry. Truncated at 10:20Z (2464 → 943) and the 10:20Z + 10:50Z entries are still inside the 6h productive window. **Defer truncation** — first cycle since the big truncation; counter sits at 0 cycles overdue. Will re-evaluate next cycle.

**Step 1 — Human Instructions:** None pending. `awk` over WORKLOG.md (excluding fenced code blocks) for `^## INSTRUCTION:` → empty.

**Step 2 — Active Workers (pre-this-spawn):** Prior cycle's implementation worker `1f83ee2` reports `execution_status=finished, sandbox_status=RUNNING` → finished. (Also: `002934f` from 10:20Z still `PAUSED, execution_status=null` — finished long ago.) PR slot is **free** for the next handoff. Expansion slot idle.

**Step 3 — State gathered:**
- **PR #175 — `feat(filter): add engagement-level filters to list and gen subcommands`** (closes #170): branch `feat/170-engagement-filters`, opened 11:11Z, last commit 11:10Z, ready (not draft).
- **PR #175 status (lxa-style):** `oR green ready 1 💬` — opened, **R**eviewed by `github-actions` `pr-review` bot (state `COMMENTED`, verdict 🟡 "Acceptable — Clean implementation with comprehensive testing. One minor documentation enhancement suggested"), `lint` + `pytest` both **SUCCESS**, `mergeable=MERGEABLE`, `mergeStateStatus=CLEAN`.
- **PR #175 changed files:** `src/ohtv/cli.py`, `src/ohtv/filters.py`, 4 new test files (`test_filters_duration.py`, `test_cli_engagement_filter.py`, `test_cli_list_engagement_filter.py`, `test_cli_gen_engagement_filter.py`), `uv.lock`. **No `README.md` in the diff** — docs gap confirmed.
- **README scan:** `grep -nE "engagement|--engaged" README.md` → 0 hits. New `--engaged` / `--no-engaged` / `--min-engaged` / `--min-engagement-ratio` flags across `list` + 3 `gen` subcommands are completely undocumented.
- **Open PRs:** 1 (PR #175). **Issues needing expansion:** 0. **Ready issues (4):** #170 (in flight via PR #175), #161 (priority:medium), #162 (priority:medium), #173 (priority:low). On hold: #26, #90.

**Step 4 — Decision (per orchestrate decision tree):**
- PR slot: `PR exists, ready, CI green, **README not updated**` → **Spawn docs worker.** ✅ User-facing surface is 4 new CLI flags × 4 commands — canonical docs trigger. The `pr-review` bot's minor inline comment is deferred to a later review-handler worker (out of scope for the docs worker per the orchestrate workflow sequence "Docs Update → Manual Testing → Review").
- Expansion slot: 0 issues need expansion → **stay idle.** ✅

**Step 5 — Spawned: Docs Worker**
- PR: [#175 — feat(filter): add engagement-level filters](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/pull/175) (closes #170)
- Start task: `d5eb0c17` → `app_conversation_id = ee9bfd9a84474e1e995e7b2d3371d7c6`
- Conversation: [`ee9bfd9`](https://app.all-hands.dev/conversations/ee9bfd9a84474e1e995e7b2d3371d7c6)
- Polling timeline: `WORKING` (T+0s) → `STARTING_CONVERSATION` (T+10s) → `READY` (T+18s). First-attempt success.
- Verify (T+~20s): `execution_status=running`, `sandbox_status=RUNNING`. **Confirmed actually executing.**
- Plugin spec (unchanged, **14th successful spawn**): `{"source": "github:jpshackelford/.openhands", "repo_path": "plugins/ohtv-workflow", "ref": "feat/ohtv-workflow-plugin"}`.
- Spawn payload contract: `initial_message: {content: [{type:"text", text:"…"}], run: true}` (V1 — 14 in a row).
- Auth header: `X-Access-Token: $OPENHANDS_API_KEY`.
- Prompt scope: checkout PR branch → read PR/Issue context → add an "Engagement filtering" section to README.md documenting the 4 flags + 3 copy-pasteable examples + missing-row semantics callout + `conversation_engagement` provenance note → also touch `docs/guides/`/`docs/reference/cli.md` if the existing patterns warrant → commit `docs: …` → push → wait for CI green → post PR comment summarizing the docs changes (with AI-agent disclosure) → WORKLOG entry on main → EXIT. Explicit OUT-OF-SCOPE: inline pr-review bot comment (review-handler's job), manual tests (testing worker next), any `src/`/`tests/` edits.

**Step 6 — Quiet-cycle check:** Productive cycle (1 worker spawned). Auto-disable counter stays at **0**.

**Cycle expectations for next 1–3 cycles (~30–90 min):**
- **Next cycle (~11:50Z):** Most likely —
  - ~50%: Docs worker `ee9bfd9` still running. README edit is small but the worker also has to test examples and may iterate.
  - ~35%: Docs commit pushed, CI green, docs PR comment posted → spawn **testing worker** (PR slot occupied by testing role).
  - ~10%: Docs commit lands but CI flakes / lint trips → wait or spawn fix.
  - ~5%: Worker mis-scopes (touches code) — pr-review will catch on next review pass.
- **2 cycles out (~12:20Z):** Testing worker reporting "ALL TESTS PASS" or surfacing a doc-vs-behavior mismatch (which is the whole point of docs-before-testing). Review worker handles the minor pr-review inline comment in parallel-ish, then merge.
- **3 cycles out (~12:50Z):** PR #175 squash-merged → `ohtv-v0.26.0` (next minor, `feat:` subject) → engagement-metric family **4/4 done** 🎉 → ready queue shifts to #161/#162/#173.

**Notes / follow-ups carried forward (cumulative):**
- **`initial_message` spawn-payload contract** stays pinned. **14 successful spawns** in a row with `{"initial_message": {"content": [{"type":"text","text":"…"}], "run": true}}`.
- **Spawn auth header:** `X-Access-Token: $OPENHANDS_API_KEY` (per `/spawn-conversation` skill).
- **Plugin spec format unchanged:** 14th successful spawn — `{"source": "github:jpshackelford/.openhands", "repo_path": "plugins/ohtv-workflow", "ref": "feat/ohtv-workflow-plugin"}`.
- **`GH_TOKEN` shim:** `GH_TOKEN` was unset this cycle; `GITHUB_TOKEN` and `github_token` both populated. `export GH_TOKEN="${GITHUB_TOKEN:-$github_token}"` worked. The shim keeps flipping between cycles; keep checking both.
- **Tool install pattern:** This cycle used the `uv sync`-installed `.venv` (because the workspace was a fresh clone with no `~/.local/bin/lxa`/`ohtv`). Either `uv tool install` (10:50Z), `uv venv .venv` (10:20Z), or `uv sync` (this cycle) gets it done; pick the one matching the sandbox state.
- **lxa initial board creation** is silent and cosmetic — `lxa repo add` works the same with or without a pre-named board. Not worth fixing.
- **`ohtv sync` can stall >30s** on cold runs even with `--since 4h --quiet`. Don't gate decisions on it — `gh pr list` + `lxa pr list` + `gh issue list` cover the orchestrator state surface independently. Cached follow-up.
- **`pr-review` bot leaves verdicts as `state=COMMENTED` (not `APPROVED`)** when verdict is 🟡 Acceptable with inline suggestions. So `reviewDecision` stays `""` even when the review is positive. Use the review-body verdict tag (🟢/🟡/🔴) as the source of truth for review-handler dispatch. New cached learning this cycle.
- **GitHub CLI `gh pr view --comments` only returns issue-style comments, not review-thread comments.** Use `gh pr view --json reviews` (or GraphQL `pullRequest.reviewThreads`) for review content. Cached.
- **Engagement-metric family progress:** #167 ✅, #168 ✅, #169 ✅, #170 → PR #175 docs-in-flight → expected merge within 2 cycles → 4/4 done.
- **`statusCheckRollup` remains the source of truth for "is CI green?"** Both `lint` and `pytest` SUCCESS on the head commit of `feat/170-engagement-filters`.

**Local checkout note:** `main` HEAD at `2a8eab0` on entry (the prior orchestrator's worklog commit). This entry pushes one more chore(worklog) commit on top. Local `uv.lock` had a 1-line drift from `uv sync` — discarded before rebase. No code branches created by orchestrator.

EXIT per orchestrate skill — next cycle (~30 min) checks `ee9bfd9` (docs worker), the README.md diff on PR #175, the pushed docs commit's CI, and (if all green) spawns the manual-testing worker.

### 2026-06-04 11:25 UTC - Implementation Worker (Issue #170 → PR #175)

✅ **Opened PR [#175](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/pull/175) — `feat(filter): add engagement-level filters to list and gen subcommands` (Closes [#170](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/issues/170)).**

- Branch: `feat/170-engagement-filters` off `main @ 5124eec` (post-#174 merge).
- CI: lint ✓ · pytest ✓ · enable-orchestrator ✓ (1m4s).
- PR marked ready for review.

**What shipped:**
- Four new flags on `ohtv list`, `gen objs`, `gen titles`, `gen run`:
  - `--engaged` — keep rows with `engaged_seconds > 0`.
  - `--no-engaged` — fire-and-forget (missing row OR `engaged_seconds == 0`). Only flag that treats a missing engagement row as *include*.
  - `--min-engaged DURATION` — accepts `5m` / `30s` / `1h` / `1h30m` (case-insensitive) / bare int|float interpreted as minutes (`5` == `5m`).
  - `--min-engagement-ratio PCT` — float `[0, 100]`. Rows with `total_duration_seconds == 0` or NULL excluded.
- Shared decorator `engagement_filter_options` + shared validator `_validate_engagement_filter_args` — both consumed by `_apply_conversation_filters`, so the four call sites share one error path (`click.BadParameter`, exit 2) **before any DB work**.
- New `ohtv.filters.parse_duration_to_seconds(value: str) -> int` — reusable for any future duration parsing.
- Engagement lookup reuses **PR #171's batched** `_load_engagement_for_conversations` — single `WHERE conversation_id IN (?, ?, …)` chunked at 900 IDs. **Zero per-row queries.**
- Engagement filter runs last in `_apply_conversation_filters` (after `--errors-only`), so it composes cleanly with every existing filter (`--repo`, `--pr`, `--action`, `--label`, `--since`, `--until`, `--errors-only`) and every existing display knob (`--with-engagement`, `--reverse`, `--max`, `--include-empty`, `--no-refs`, `--idle`).

**Key decisions (recorded for future readers):**
1. **Bare numeric = minutes, not seconds.** `parse_duration_to_seconds("5") == 300`. Matches the issue body's UX intuition ("`--min-engaged 5` == `--min-engaged 5m`"). Cross-referenced in the helper docstring and locked in by an explicit test (`test_bare_integer_is_minutes`).
2. **Missing-row semantics asymmetric.** `--no-engaged` includes never-processed conversations (fire-and-forget intent); `--engaged` / `--min-engaged` / `--min-engagement-ratio` exclude them ("no data → cannot prove threshold"). Mirrors PR #171's display behavior of rendering `-` for missing rows, but for filtering we have to collapse the tri-state into a binary include/exclude.
3. **Ratio threshold and zero-duration rows.** A row with `total_duration_seconds == 0` or NULL cannot have a defined ratio and is excluded under threshold flags — not silently treated as 0%. Tested explicitly.
4. **`--engaged + --min-engaged` permitted (not an error).** The threshold flag implies engagement; `--engaged` is silently absorbed. Only `--engaged + --no-engaged` and `--no-engaged + threshold flag` raise `BadParameter`.

**Test coverage:**
- 90 new unit + integration tests across four files:
  - `tests/unit/test_filters_duration.py` — 39 unit tests for `parse_duration_to_seconds` (h/m/s combos, bare numerics, case-insensitivity, rejection of negatives / nonsense).
  - `tests/unit/test_cli_engagement_filter.py` — 22 unit tests for the validator + `_filter_by_engagement` per-flag semantics + missing-row table.
  - `tests/unit/test_cli_list_engagement_filter.py` — 19 end-to-end `CliRunner` tests against a seeded SQLite DB (every flag's row set, every composition, mutual-exclusion + duration-parse errors, `--help` text).
  - `tests/unit/test_cli_gen_engagement_filter.py` — 10 integration tests verifying the same flag surface is wired into `gen objs`, `gen titles`, `gen run` (mutual-exclusion + invalid-duration paths + `gen objs --min-engaged 5m` actually shrinks the analysis batch).
- Total: **2 443 unit tests pass**, 2 skipped, 3 xfailed (the cloud-sync behavioral harness xfails per AGENTS.md "Testing" section).

**Out of scope (deferred per the issue body):**
- `--max-engaged DURATION` — easy follow-up if a use case emerges.
- `--sort engaged` — orthogonal to filtering; needs its own issue.
- Auto-running the engagement stage when rows are missing — explicitly out of scope; users should run `ohtv db process all` (or `ohtv sync`, which runs all stages).
- Engagement schema or stage-algorithm changes — Issue #163 / PR #165 territory.

**Engagement-metric family progress:**
- #167 ✅ merged (engagement processing stage + DB column)
- #168 ✅ merged (`--with-engagement` JSON output via PR #172)
- #169 ✅ merged (markdown sub-bullet via PR #174)
- **#170 → PR [#175](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/pull/175) (this PR) — ready for review.**

### 2026-06-04 11:35 UTC - Docs Worker (PR #175)

✅ **Documentation landed for PR [#175](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/pull/175) before manual testing.** Pushed `76828f8` to `feat/170-engagement-filters`; both CI checks (lint + pytest) green.

**Scope:** `README.md` + `docs/guides/exploration.md` + `docs/guides/analysis.md` + `docs/reference/cli.md`. No code touched (per task brief — `src/` and `tests/` are explicitly out of scope for this worker).

**What changed:**
- **README.md** — new top-level **Engagement filtering** section (between *Commands* and *Configuration*) with the 4-flag table, mutual-exclusion summary, 4 copy-pasteable examples on `list`/`gen objs`/`gen titles`, an explicit missing-row semantics callout for `--no-engaged`, and a prerequisite pointer to the `engagement` indexing stage (#163 / #165). One-line feature bullet added near the top of the README.
- **docs/guides/exploration.md** — 4 new flag rows in the `ohtv list` Options table; new dedicated **Engagement filters** subsection right after **Engagement columns** with the full missing-row truth table, `--min-engaged` duration grammar (incl. the `5` ≡ `5m` ≠ `5s` trap from the issue's UX rationale), mutual-exclusion rules, and 5 examples. Rewrote the prior "filtering is deferred to #170" deferral notice (was sitting under the `--with-engagement` subsection) to point at the now-shipped subsection.
- **docs/guides/analysis.md** — 4 new flag rows in `gen objs` (multi-conversation), `gen titles`, and `gen run` Options tables; new **Engagement filters** subsection with `gen`-specific examples. Rewrote the matching "deferred to #170" deferral notice.
- **docs/reference/cli.md** — extended the `ohtv list` / `gen objs` / `gen titles` / `gen run` rows to mention the new filter flags and deep-link to the relevant guide subsection.

**Quality bar (per task brief):**
- Every example in the README and both guides was executed against a fresh `OHTV_DIR` on the PR branch (`uv sync` clean). All commands parse, validate, mutually-exclude correctly, and exit 0.
- Caught one issue-body bug during the example pass: the original issue #170 used `--since 30d` / `--since 7d` shorthand — that syntax is wired into `ohtv ask` (RAG temporal filter) only, NOT `--since` on `list`/`gen` (which only accept `today` + ISO date via `click.DateTime`). Docs use `-D N` (last N days) and `--week` instead, both of which work today. Worth flagging if anyone wants `--since 7d` to actually work on `list` — that's a separate issue.
- Style matches the existing `--with-engagement` documentation: same anchor naming (`<a id="engagement-filters-...">`), same "Composes with other flags" / "Prerequisite" phrasing, same per-command Options-table row format.
- No invented doc surface. No duplicate engagement explanations — all four docs cross-reference the same canonical subsection in exploration.md.
- The inline review comment from the `github-actions` `pr-review` bot is intentionally NOT addressed (per task brief — review-handler worker's scope, not docs worker's).

**PR comment posted:** [#175 (comment) 4621720085](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/pull/175#issuecomment-4621720085) — summarizes the four edited files with the AI-agent disclosure line.

**Next worker:** manual testing on a populated `OHTV_DIR` (separate conversation). Testers should verify documented behavior matches actual behavior on real data — in particular the `--no-engaged` missing-row semantics, the `--min-engaged 5 == 5m` duration trap, and the mutual-exclusion exit codes.

### 2026-06-04 11:50 UTC - Orchestrator

**Active Workers:**

| Conv ID | Type | Working On | Status |
|---------|------|------------|--------|
| `325ebc8` | testing | PR #175 — engagement filters manual test | **NEW** (running, first poll) |

**Step 0 — Setup:** `pip install --user git+…/lxa.git git+…/ohtv.git` (system Python had `~/.local/bin` writable this cycle — neither `uv venv` nor `uv tool install` needed). Added `~/.local/bin` to PATH. `lxa repo add` was a fresh add (cosmetic board creation, no behavior impact). `ohtv sync` skipped this cycle — `gh pr list` + `gh issue list` + `lxa pr list` cover all state-gating needs.

**Step 0.5 — Housekeeping:** WORKLOG.md is **1270 lines** at cycle entry (last truncation 10:20Z, 1.5h ago). Still inside the 6-hour productive window for every entry (10:22 merge → 10:50 spawn → 11:20 orchestrator → 11:25 impl → 11:35 docs). **Defer truncation one more cycle** — aggressive truncation would preserve all current entries anyway, so no urgency, and this cycle is already productive (spawning testing worker). Will re-evaluate next cycle once the 10:22Z merge entry ages past the cutoff.

**Step 1 — Human Instructions:** None pending. `awk` over WORKLOG.md (excluding fenced code blocks) for `^## INSTRUCTION:` → empty.

**Step 2 — Active Workers (pre-this-spawn):** Prior cycle's docs worker `ee9bfd9` reports `execution_status=finished, sandbox_status=RUNNING` → **finished**. PR slot is **free** for the next handoff. Expansion slot has been idle for many cycles.

**Step 3 — State gathered:**
- **PR #175 — `feat(filter): add engagement-level filters to list and gen subcommands`** (closes #170): branch `feat/170-engagement-filters`, last commit `76828f8` (docs commit) at 11:28Z, ready (not draft).
- **PR #175 status:** `oRF green ready` — opened, **R**eviewed (🟡 by `pr-review` bot earlier, one minor inline), **F**ixes pushed (docs commit), CI green (`lint` SUCCESS @ 11:28:34Z, `pytest` SUCCESS @ 11:29:38Z). `mergeable=UNKNOWN`/`mergeStateStatus=UNKNOWN` (GitHub-side cache lag — `statusCheckRollup` is the source of truth, cached learning carries forward).
- **PR #175 changed files (post-docs commit):** `README.md`, `docs/guides/analysis.md`, `docs/guides/exploration.md`, `docs/reference/cli.md`, `src/ohtv/cli.py`, `src/ohtv/filters.py`, 4 new test files, `uv.lock`. **README.md present in diff** — docs gap closed.
- **PR comment confirms docs:** `jpshackelford` (the docs worker pushed under that identity) posted **"Documentation updated for PR #175."** at 11:30:06Z, summarizing the 4 edited doc files.
- **Manual test results scan:** `gh pr view 175 --json comments --jq '.comments[] | select(.body | test("Manual Test Results"; "i"))'` → empty. **No manual test results yet.**
- **Open PRs:** 1 (PR #175). **Issues needing expansion:** 0. **Ready issues (4):** #170 (in flight via PR #175), #161 (priority:medium), #162 (priority:medium), #173 (priority:low). On hold: #26, #90.

**Step 4 — Decision (per orchestrate decision tree):**
- PR slot: `PR exists, ready, CI green, docs updated, **no manual test results**` → **Spawn testing worker.** ✅ Even though `pr-review` bot already left a 🟡 inline comment, per the orchestrate skill explicitly: *"Testing step is NOT skipped just because review started. CI must be green to test."* — and CI is green on the docs head commit.
- Expansion slot: 0 issues need expansion → **stay idle.** ✅

**Step 5 — Spawned: Testing Worker**
- PR: [#175 — feat(filter): add engagement-level filters](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/pull/175) (closes #170)
- Start task: `456f43e2` → `app_conversation_id = 325ebc8107c149248fffb92b06490188`
- Conversation: [`325ebc8`](https://app.all-hands.dev/conversations/325ebc8107c149248fffb92b06490188)
- Polling timeline: `STARTING_CONVERSATION` (T+7s) → `READY` (T+14s). **2-poll spawn — second-fastest observed.** First-attempt success.
- Verify (T+~20s): `execution_status=running`, `sandbox_status=RUNNING`. **Confirmed actually executing.**
- Plugin spec (unchanged, **15th successful spawn**): `{"source": "github:jpshackelford/.openhands", "repo_path": "plugins/ohtv-workflow", "ref": "feat/ohtv-workflow-plugin"}`.
- Spawn payload contract: `initial_message: {content: [{type:"text", text:"…"}], run: true}` (V1 — 15 in a row).
- Auth header: `X-Access-Token: $OPENHANDS_API_KEY`.
- Prompt scope: clone + `gh pr checkout 175` → `uv sync` → run on a real populated `OHTV_DIR` (ensure `ohtv db process all` covers the `engagement` stage) → execute the enumerated blackbox checks (mutual-exclusion exit code 2, duration grammar incl. `5` ≡ `5m`, invalid-duration BEFORE-DB rejection, asymmetric missing-row semantics for `--no-engaged` vs all other flags, composition with `--repo`/`--pr`/`--since`/`-D N`/`--errors-only`/`--include-empty`, zero-duration ratio handling, cross-command surface on all 4 commands, performance non-regression vs batched `_load_engagement_for_conversations`) → `uv run pytest -q` for unit-test count → post `## Manual Test Results` PR comment with AI-agent disclosure → WORKLOG entry on `main` → EXIT. Explicit OUT-OF-SCOPE: pr-review bot's inline comment, code changes, doc changes.

**Step 6 — Quiet-cycle check:** Productive cycle (1 worker spawned + docs-worker completion confirmed). Auto-disable counter stays at **0**.

**Cycle expectations for next 1–3 cycles (~30–90 min):**
- **Next cycle (~12:20Z):** Most likely —
  - ~55%: Testing worker `325ebc8` still running. Real-data testing on `~/.ohtv/` with the full engagement stage processed + 9 enumerated checks + 2 443+ unit tests is real work. Expect 25–60 min.
  - ~25%: Test report posted (ALL PASS or PARTIAL PASS) → PR has both reviews AND test results → spawn **review worker** to address the pr-review bot's minor inline comment.
  - ~10%: Test report surfaces a real bug → wait for next orchestrator cycle to decide between review-handler or implementation-fix worker.
  - ~5%: Worker hits an infra issue (cloud sync stall, etc.) and exits without a report → re-spawn next cycle.
  - ~5%: Worker overruns into the review-handler scope.
- **2 cycles out (~12:50Z):** Review handler addresses the 🟡 inline comment, PR ready for merge.
- **3 cycles out (~13:20Z):** PR #175 squash-merged → `ohtv-v0.26.0` (`feat:` subject auto-bumps minor) → engagement-metric family **4/4 done** 🎉 → ready queue shifts to #161/#162/#173. Expansion slot still idle (0 issues need expansion).

**Notes / follow-ups carried forward (cumulative):**
- **`initial_message` spawn-payload contract** stays pinned. **15 successful spawns** in a row with `{"initial_message": {"content": [{"type":"text","text":"…"}], "run": true}}`. Never use deprecated `initial_user_msg`.
- **Spawn auth header:** `X-Access-Token: $OPENHANDS_API_KEY`. Other endpoints accept `Authorization: Bearer $OPENHANDS_API_KEY` — both work.
- **Plugin spec format unchanged:** 15th successful spawn — `{"source": "github:jpshackelford/.openhands", "repo_path": "plugins/ohtv-workflow", "ref": "feat/ohtv-workflow-plugin"}`.
- **`GH_TOKEN` shim:** This cycle `GH_TOKEN` was unset; `GITHUB_TOKEN` populated, `github_token` populated. `export GH_TOKEN="${GITHUB_TOKEN:-$github_token}"` worked. The shim keeps flipping between cycles — check both, always.
- **Tool install pattern (cycle-dependent):** This cycle `pip install --user …` worked because `~/.local/bin` was writable. Previous cycles used `uv venv .venv` (10:20Z), `uv tool install` (10:50Z), or `uv sync` (11:20Z). Try plain `pip install --user` first — fastest path when it works.
- **`ohtv sync` can stall >30s** on cold runs even with `--since 4h --quiet`. Don't gate decisions on it — `gh pr list` + `lxa pr list` + `gh issue list` cover state independently. Skipped this cycle.
- **`pr-review` bot leaves verdicts as `state=COMMENTED` (not `APPROVED`)** when verdict is 🟡 Acceptable with inline suggestions → `reviewDecision` stays empty even when review is positive. Use the verdict tag (🟢/🟡/🔴) as the source of truth for review-handler dispatch.
- **`gh pr view --comments` only returns issue-style comments, not review-thread comments.** Use `gh pr view --json reviews` (or GraphQL `pullRequest.reviewThreads`) for review content. Cached.
- **Engagement-metric family progress:** #167 ✅, #168 ✅, #169 ✅, #170 → PR #175 testing-in-flight → expected merge within 2 cycles → **4/4 done** 🎉.
- **`statusCheckRollup` remains the source of truth for "is CI green?"** Both `lint` and `pytest` SUCCESS on the head commit `76828f8` (docs commit) of `feat/170-engagement-filters`.
- **Worklog truncation policy:** prefer to defer when the productive 6h window still covers all entries (aggressive truncation preserves them anyway); run when the file is both >1500 lines AND the cycle is otherwise non-productive.

**Local checkout note:** `main` HEAD at `4077c70` on entry (the docs worker's worklog commit, which is also the only ref the shallow grafted clone has). This entry pushes one more chore(worklog) commit on top. No code branches created by orchestrator.

EXIT per orchestrate skill — next cycle (~30 min) checks `325ebc8` (testing worker), the PR #175 comments for a `## Manual Test Results` entry, and (if a clean test report exists) spawns the review-handler worker to address the pr-review bot's 🟡 inline comment.

### 2026-06-04 12:18 UTC - Orchestrator

**Active Workers:**

| Conv ID | Type | Working On | Status |
|---------|------|------------|--------|
| `e408d8c` | review | PR #175 — engagement filters (1 thread to resolve) | **NEW** (running, first poll) |

**Step 0 — Setup:** Fresh workspace clone; `uv tool install` of both `lxa` and `ohtv` from GitHub succeeded (system `pip install --system` was blocked by perms — `uv tool` is the right pattern for this sandbox shape). Tools added to `PATH=/home/openhands/.local/bin:$PATH`. `lxa repo add jpshackelford/ohtv` no-op (already present). Skipped `ohtv sync` — `gh` + GraphQL covered every gating signal this cycle.

**Step 0.5 — Housekeeping:** WORKLOG.md is **1373 lines** at entry (>300 threshold by ~4.6×). Prior cycle (11:20Z) explicitly deferred truncation as "first cycle since big truncation, counter 0". **Defer again this cycle** — only one productive entry has landed since the last truncation (testing worker 12:06Z), so the 6h productive-window guard would protect almost everything anyway. Counter at **1 cycle overdue**. Next orchestrator cycle should run `/truncate-worklog` unconditionally.

**Step 1 — Human Instructions:** None. `grep -B1 -A5 "^## INSTRUCTION:" WORKLOG.md` → empty.

**Step 2 — Active Workers (pre-this-spawn):** Polled `app-conversations/search?limit=50`:
- Docs worker `ee9bfd9` (spawned 11:20Z): `exec=null, sandbox=PAUSED` → **finished** (commit `76828f8` at 11:28Z landed: README.md + docs/guides/{analysis,exploration}.md + docs/reference/cli.md).
- Testing worker (12:06Z report) — not separately listed under a known ID but per the worklog entry it self-terminated after posting test report.
- `cf15e8a` is `running` but `created_at=2026-06-04T12:15:46Z` → **this orchestrator conversation itself**, not a worker. Ignored.
- → Both PR slot and expansion slot **free**.

**Step 3 — State gathered:**
- **PR #175 — `feat(filter): add engagement-level filters to list and gen subcommands`** (closes #170): branch `feat/170-engagement-filters`, HEAD `76828f8` (last commit 11:28:20Z), **ready** (not draft).
- **PR #175 CI:** `lint` SUCCESS, `pytest` SUCCESS (statusCheckRollup).
- **PR #175 docs status:** `README.md`, `docs/guides/analysis.md`, `docs/guides/exploration.md`, `docs/reference/cli.md` all in the diff. **Docs updated.** ✅
- **PR #175 manual test status:** Testing worker posted 12:06Z (comment `4621960813`): **ALL PASS** against HEAD `76828f8`. 2492 unit tests pass. Test surface covered mutex / duration grammar / missing-row asymmetry / ratio+zero-duration / composition with `--repo`/`--pr`/`--since`/`-D`/`--include-empty`/`--errors-only` / format-independence (table/json/csv) / all 4 commands (`list`, `gen objs`, `gen titles`, `gen run`) / batched 1-IN-query SQL. Test results match current HEAD → **not outdated**. ✅
- **Open review threads: 1** (`PRRT_kwDOR9seq86HDUYb`, unresolved, isOutdated=false). Author `github-actions` (pr-review bot), on `src/ohtv/cli.py:2318`, verdict 🟡 Acceptable. Suggests adding an "AND-composition" sentence to `--min-engaged` and `--min-engagement-ratio` help text. The pr-review bot's overall review body remains `state=COMMENTED` (not APPROVED), so `reviewDecision=""` — exactly the pattern cached in the prior worklog. Verdict tag in body is the source of truth.
- **Open PRs:** 1 (PR #175). **Issues needing expansion:** 0. **Ready issues (4):** #170 (in flight via PR #175), #161 (priority:medium), #162 (priority:medium), #173 (priority:low). On hold: #26, #90.

**Step 4 — Decision (per orchestrate decision tree):**
- PR slot: `PR exists, ready, CI green, test results valid, 💬 > 0` → **Spawn review worker.** ✅
- Expansion slot: 0 issues need expansion → **stay idle.** ✅

- Conversation: [`e408d8c`](https://app.all-hands.dev/conversations/e408d8c85617488f80a612e44e86545c)
- Polling timeline: posted at ~12:17Z, polled at ~12:18Z → `status=READY` on first poll (well under the typical 18s `WORKING→READY` window — task picker was warm).
- Verify (T+~30s): `execution_status=running`, `sandbox_status=RUNNING`. **Confirmed actually executing.**
- Plugin spec (unchanged, **15th successful spawn**): `{"source": "github:jpshackelford/.openhands", "repo_path": "plugins/ohtv-workflow", "ref": "feat/ohtv-workflow-plugin"}`.
- Spawn payload contract: `initial_message: {content: [{type:"text", text:"…"}], run: true}` (V1 — 15 in a row).
- Auth header: `X-Access-Token: $OPENHANDS_API_KEY`.
- **Prompt scope:** undraft PR → accept the bot's suggestion (orchestrator's read: small, helpful, no scope creep) → add AND-composition sentence to BOTH `--min-engaged` and `--min-engagement-ratio` help text across all 4 commands where they appear → `uv run pytest -q && uv run ruff check src tests` → commit with `docs(cli):` subject (release-safe — won't compete with the PR's overall `feat:` squash subject) → push → wait CI green → reply to thread `PRRT_kwDOR9seq86HDUYb` with commit SHA + resolve via GraphQL → re-ready PR → WORKLOG entry on main → EXIT. **Explicit OUT-OF-SCOPE:** README/docs (already complete), manual re-test (help-text change is below the "significant changes" heuristic), squash/merge.

**Step 6 — Quiet-cycle check:** Productive cycle (1 worker spawned). Auto-disable counter stays at **0**.

**Cycle expectations for next 1–3 cycles (~30–90 min):**
- **Next cycle (~12:48Z):** Most likely —
  - ~55%: Review worker `e408d8c` still running (help-text edit is trivial but PR-undraft + GraphQL thread-resolve dance + waiting for CI takes a few minutes).
  - ~30%: Review fix pushed, CI green, thread resolved, PR back to ready → spawn **merge worker** (help-text-only change → no re-test, no docs spot-check needed per the AGENTS-style heuristics).
  - ~10%: pr-review bot files a follow-up round on the help-text wording → another review worker.
  - ~5%: Worker mis-scopes (re-edits docs/tests) — minor noise, won't block.
- **2 cycles out (~13:18Z):** PR #175 squash-merged → `ohtv-v0.26.0` (next minor, `feat:` subject) → engagement-metric family **4/4 done** 🎉 → ready queue shifts to #161/#162/#173.
- **3 cycles out (~13:48Z):** Implementation worker for the highest-priority remaining ready issue. None are `priority:high` after #170 closes — #161/#162 are `priority:medium`, #173 is `priority:low`. Orchestrator will run `/assess-priority` inline if no `priority:high` lands by then.

**Notes / follow-ups carried forward (cumulative):**
- **`initial_message` spawn-payload contract** stays pinned. **15 successful spawns** in a row with `{"initial_message": {"content": [{"type":"text","text":"…"}], "run": true}}`.
- **Spawn auth header:** `X-Access-Token: $OPENHANDS_API_KEY`.
- **Plugin spec format unchanged.**
- **Start-task polling endpoint:** `GET /api/v1/app-conversations/start-tasks/search` (the bare `start-task/{id}` path returns the SPA HTML — not an error, just the wrong endpoint). Cached so future cycles don't waste polls.
- **`GH_TOKEN` shim:** `GH_TOKEN` was unset this cycle; `GITHUB_TOKEN` and `github_token` both populated. `export GH_TOKEN="${GITHUB_TOKEN:-$github_token}"` worked. Shim keeps flipping between cycles; keep checking both.
- **Tool install pattern (refined):** This cycle used `uv tool install git+https://github.com/jpshackelford/{lxa,ohtv}.git`. System-wide `uv pip install --system` was blocked by `/usr/local/lib/python3.13/site-packages` perms (matches prior cycles' findings). `uv tool install` is the most reliable fresh-clone pattern for this sandbox shape; `uv sync` works when the local checkout has a usable `pyproject.toml` (it does).
- **PR-review bot verdict-vs-state mismatch:** the bot leaves overall review `state=COMMENTED` (not APPROVED) even on 🟡 Acceptable verdicts. So `reviewDecision` stays `""`. Use the 🟢/🟡/🔴 tag in the review body as source of truth for review-handler dispatch. Confirmed again this cycle.
- **Review threads vs PR comments:** `gh pr view --comments` only returns issue-style comments. Use `gh api graphql … reviewThreads` to read review threads, and the same GraphQL mutations to reply/resolve them. Cached.
- **WORKLOG truncation:** 1373 lines, deferred once more, counter at **1 cycle overdue**. Next cycle should run `/truncate-worklog` unconditionally.
- **Engagement-metric family progress:** #167 ✅, #168 ✅, #169 ✅, #170 → PR #175 review-in-flight → expected merge within 1–2 cycles → 4/4 done.

**Local checkout note:** `main` HEAD at `1bed76f` on entry (testing worker's 12:06Z worklog commit). This entry pushes one more `chore(worklog)` commit on top. No code branches created by orchestrator.

EXIT per orchestrate skill — next cycle (~30 min) checks `e408d8c` (review worker), the pushed docs/cli commit's CI, the resolution status of thread `PRRT_kwDOR9seq86HDUYb`, and (if all green and no new threads) spawns the merge worker.

### 2026-06-04 12:25 UTC - Review Worker (PR #175, round 1)

**Worker Type:** review
**PR:** [#175 — feat(filter): engagement-level filters](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/pull/175)
**Branch:** `feat/170-engagement-filters`
**Commit:** `7a067f7`

**Single thread addressed:** `PRRT_kwDOR9seq86HDUYb` (🟡 Acceptable) — bot suggested
documenting AND-composition of `--min-engaged` + `--min-engagement-ratio` in
`--help`. Accepted the suggestion (small, helpful, no scope creep). Added a
sentence to both flags' help text in the shared
`engagement_filter_options` decorator so all four commands (`list`,
`gen objs`, `gen titles`, `gen run`) get the update from one site.

**Test impact:** None. The existing `test_both_thresholds_must_both_pass`
already locks the AND-composition behavior, and no tests assert on
help-text substrings.

**CI status (post-push):** lint ✓ · pytest ✓ (2492 passed, 2 skipped, 3 xfailed)

**Thread state:** Replied and resolved via GraphQL.
**PR state:** Moved back from draft → ready for review.

Next cycle should check for any follow-up review comments; otherwise the
re-test heuristic should pass-through (help-text-only change is not
significant per orchestrator policy) and dispatch a merge worker.

### 2026-06-04 12:50 UTC - Orchestrator

**Active Workers:**

| Conv ID | Type | Working On | Status |
|---------|------|------------|--------|
| `d7b3f7c` | merge | PR #175 — engagement filters squash-merge | **NEW** (running, verified) |

**Step 0 — Setup:** Fresh workspace clone. `uv pip install --system` blocked by perms (matches prior cycles' findings); fell back to `pip install --user`, which placed both binaries in `~/.local/bin` — added to `PATH`. `lxa repo add` re-created an "Unnamed Board 1" (cosmetic, board persistence is per-sandbox), no behavior impact. Skipped `ohtv sync` — `gh` covers every gating signal this cycle.

**Step 0.5 — Housekeeping:** WORKLOG.md was **1476 lines** at cycle entry. Prior cycle counter was "1 cycle overdue, run unconditionally". **Truncation executed** — 19 entries scanned (8 productive, 11 status); cutoff `2026-06-04T06:21Z`; archived 7 entries to `WORKLOG_ARCHIVE_2026-06-04.md` (now 841 lines on that file, the rest landed earlier); WORKLOG.md down to 681 lines pre-this-entry. Counter reset to **0**.

**Step 1 — Human Instructions:** None. `grep -B1 -A5 "^## INSTRUCTION:" WORKLOG.md` → empty.

**Step 2 — Active Workers (pre-this-spawn):** Polled `app-conversations/search?limit=50`:
- Review worker `e408d8c` (spawned 12:17Z): `execution_status=finished, sandbox_status=RUNNING` → **finished**. Sandbox auto-pauses after the agent exits; status=finished is the source of truth.
- `cf15e8a`: prior orchestrator cycle, `sandbox_status=MISSING` → ignored.
- → PR slot **free**; expansion slot **free**.

**Step 3 — State gathered:**
- **PR #175 — `feat(filter): add engagement-level filters to list and gen subcommands`** (closes #170): branch `feat/170-engagement-filters`, HEAD `7a067f7` (review-fix commit at 12:25Z), **ready** (not draft).
- **PR #175 CI:** `lint` ✓, `pytest` ✓, `pr-review` ✓, `enable-orchestrator` ✓ — all SUCCESS @ HEAD `7a067f7`.
- **PR #175 review:** `reviewDecision: APPROVED` 🟢 (pr-review bot's final review on the help-text-clarification commit). Notable shift from the long-running pattern where the bot leaves `state=COMMENTED` — this time it actually APPROVED. Cached learning carries forward: bot can swing either way; treat APPROVED as merge-ready, treat COMMENTED + 🟢/🟡 tag in body as merge-ready too.
- **PR #175 review threads:** 1 total, **0 unresolved**. Thread `PRRT_kwDOR9seq86HDUYb` was resolved by the review worker at 12:25Z with reply pointing to commit `7a067f7`.
- **PR #175 docs status:** README + 3 docs files in the diff (docs worker @ 11:28Z). **Docs updated.** ✅
- **PR #175 manual test status:** Testing worker posted 12:06Z (comment `4621960813`): **ALL PASS** against HEAD `76828f8`. Diff `76828f8...7a067f7` = 1 commit (`docs(cli): clarify engagement threshold AND-composition in help text`), 1 file (`src/ohtv/cli.py`, +6/-4) — help-text-only Click decorator strings, no runtime behavior change. **Below "significant changes" re-test heuristic per orchestrate skill** (line: "Do NOT re-test if only… Comments or docstrings changed"). Test results remain **valid**. ✅
- **Side observation:** PR #176 (`docs: Add engagement threshold empirical tuning analysis`) merged externally during the prior cycle (`86c3750` on `origin/main`). Doc-only, no impact on PR #175. Mentioned for chain-of-custody.
- **Open PRs:** 1 (PR #175). **Issues needing expansion:** 0. **Ready issues (3 remaining after #170 merges):** #161 (priority:medium), #162 (priority:medium), #173 (priority:low). On hold: #26, #90.

**Step 4 — Decision (per orchestrate decision tree):**
- PR slot: `PR exists, ready, CI green, test results valid, 0 unresolved threads, APPROVED` → **Spawn merge worker.** ✅
  - Docs spot-check not required: only delta since last docs/test is a 10-line help-text clarification that *reinforces* the AND-composition behavior already documented in README. Per orchestrate skill: docs spot-check is for "significant review changes that may have affected documented behavior" — this delta is below the bar.
  - Re-test not required: see Step 3 analysis.
- Expansion slot: 0 issues need expansion → **stay idle.** ✅

**Step 5 — Spawned: Merge Worker**
- PR: [#175 — feat(filter): engagement filters](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/pull/175)
- Start task: `8f0c39ef` → `app_conversation_id = d7b3f7c23a3d4bb2a8a11a8a23d80ed6` → **READY** on first poll (~25s; typical warm-picker latency)
- Conversation: [`d7b3f7c`](https://app.all-hands.dev/conversations/d7b3f7c23a3d4bb2a8a11a8a23d80ed6)
- Verified `execution_status=running, sandbox_status=RUNNING` ~30s after spawn.
- Plugin spec (unchanged, **16th successful spawn**): `{"source": "github:jpshackelford/.openhands", "repo_path": "plugins/ohtv-workflow", "ref": "feat/ohtv-workflow-plugin"}`.
- Spawn payload contract (unchanged, V1): `initial_message: {content: [{type:"text", text:"…"}], run: true}`.
- Auth header: `X-Access-Token: $OPENHANDS_API_KEY`.
- **Prompt scope:** checkout PR → review diff holistically → update PR description if needed (final-state summary) → squash-merge keeping PR title `feat(filter): add engagement-level filters to list and gen subcommands` (semantic-release → minor bump → `ohtv-v0.26.0`) → verify merge state + release workflow kicks off → `chore(worklog):` WORKLOG update on main → EXIT. **Explicit OUT-OF-SCOPE:** changing the squash subject prefix, pushing code to main, re-testing, docs spot-check.
- **Endpoint hiccup caught & cached:** First spawn attempt used `POST /api/v1/app-conversations/start-tasks` (plural) → `405 Method Not Allowed`. Correct endpoint is `POST /api/v1/app-conversations` (the start-task object is the *response*, not the request path). The `start-tasks/search` GET endpoint is for polling status only. Cached this for future cycles.

**Step 6 — Quiet-cycle check:** Productive cycle (1 worker spawned + truncation executed). Auto-disable counter stays at **0**.

**Cycle expectations for next 1–3 cycles (~30–90 min):**
- **Next cycle (~13:20Z):** Most likely —
  - ~70%: Merge worker `d7b3f7c` has finished, PR #175 is **merged**, release workflow has tagged `ohtv-v0.26.0` and published the GitHub Release. Engagement-metric family **4/4 done** 🎉. Orchestrator runs `/assess-priority` inline (no `priority:high` ready issues left) and spawns implementation worker for next ready issue (likely #161 or #162, both `priority:medium`).
  - ~20%: Merge worker still running (squash + release workflow can take 1–2 min for the auto-commit to push back to main; orchestrator should treat slot as occupied).
  - ~7%: Merge encountered a stale-branch issue (PR #176 landed externally on main between testing and merge — though that was a docs-only commit so no semantic conflict expected). Worker may need a rebase/merge resolution.
  - ~3%: GitHub merge queue or branch protection caught something the gh API didn't surface.
- **2 cycles out (~13:50Z):** Implementation worker on the highest-priority ready issue. If #161 and #162 are both `priority:medium`, orchestrator picks the lowest number (#161) per FIFO convention.
- **3 cycles out (~14:20Z):** Either PR #161/#162 in flight, or — if implementation worker hit something nontrivial — still in implementation phase.

**Notes / follow-ups carried forward (cumulative):**
- **`initial_message` spawn-payload contract** stays pinned. **16 successful spawns** in a row with `{"initial_message": {"content": [{"type":"text","text":"…"}], "run": true}}`.
- **Spawn auth header:** `X-Access-Token: $OPENHANDS_API_KEY`.
- **Plugin spec format unchanged.**
- **Start-task POST endpoint:** `POST /api/v1/app-conversations` (NOT `…/start-tasks`). The response IS a start-task object. Cached after this cycle's 405.
- **Start-task polling endpoint:** `GET /api/v1/app-conversations/start-tasks/search`.
- **`GH_TOKEN` shim:** worked again this cycle via `export GH_TOKEN="${GITHUB_TOKEN:-$github_token}"`.
- **Tool install pattern:** This cycle `pip install --user` worked (was previously blocked); `uv tool install` also works when needed. Either is fine; prefer `pip install --user` for speed unless perms block it.
- **PR-review bot:** can leave APPROVED OR COMMENTED-with-tag verdicts. Both are merge-ready signals. This cycle saw the APPROVED path.
- **Review threads vs PR comments:** `gh pr view --comments` only returns issue-style comments. Use `gh api graphql … reviewThreads` for review threads.
- **WORKLOG truncation:** ran this cycle, counter reset to 0. Next truncation when WORKLOG > 300 lines again (currently 681 + this entry).
- **Engagement-metric family progress:** #167 ✅, #168 ✅, #169 ✅, #170 → PR #175 merge-in-flight → expected 4/4 done within 1 cycle.

**Local checkout note:** `main` HEAD at `86c3750` on entry. This entry commits truncation (archive file + slim WORKLOG.md) + this cycle entry as `chore(worklog):`. No code branches touched by orchestrator.

EXIT per orchestrate skill — next cycle (~30 min) checks `d7b3f7c` (merge worker), PR #175 state (expect `merged`), `ohtv-v0.26.0` release on GitHub, and (if all green) dispatches an implementation worker for the next priority-medium ready issue.

### 2026-06-04 13:18 UTC - Orchestrator

**Active Workers:**

| Conv ID | Type | Working On | Status |
|---------|------|------------|--------|
| `7a6ca22` | implementation | Issue #161 — `ohtv ask` prompt-based agent mode | **NEW** (running, verified) |

**Step 0 — Setup:** Fresh workspace clone (grafted, single-commit history). `uv sync` succeeded; activated `.venv/` and installed `lxa` via `uv pip install git+…/lxa.git` inside the project venv (no `--user` fallback needed this cycle). `ohtv` came in via `uv sync`. Skipped `ohtv sync` — `gh` covers every gating signal.

**Step 0.5 — Housekeeping:** WORKLOG.md at **787 lines** on entry (vs 681 post-last-truncation at 12:50Z; the merge worker + prior orchestrator added ~106 lines of legitimate recent productive entries). Truncation threshold is >300 lines, **but** the orchestrate skill's policy is to archive entries "older than 6 hours of productive work" — 13:18Z minus 6h = 07:18Z. Every entry currently in WORKLOG.md is from 06:54Z onwards (the prior cycle archived through 06:21Z), so the 6h-window is essentially empty of archivable entries. **Skipping truncation this cycle**; next cycle will likely have room to trim.

**Step 1 — Human Instructions:** None. `grep -B1 -A5 "^## INSTRUCTION:" WORKLOG.md` → empty.

**Step 2 — Active Workers (pre-this-spawn):**
- Merge worker `d7b3f7c` (spawned 12:50Z): `execution_status=finished, sandbox_status=RUNNING` → **finished ✓**. Worker's deliverable on `main` is commit `f06f359` (`chore(worklog): merge worker — PR #175 squash-merged (#170 closed)`).
- Prior review worker `e408d8c`: `sandbox_status=PAUSED` → ignored.
- → **PR slot free**; **expansion slot free**.

**Step 3 — State gathered:**
- **PR #175 — engagement filters:** state=**MERGED** at 12:50:55Z by jpshackelford (merge commit `3c8c5272`). Closed issue #170. ✅
- **`ohtv-v0.26.0` released:** tagged `78bafee` (`chore(release): ohtv 0.26.0 [skip ci]`), GitHub Release published ~24 min ago. **Engagement-metric family 4/4 done** 🎉 (#167, #168, #169, #170 all merged).
- **Open PRs:** 0.
- **Issues needing expansion (no `ready`, no `hold`):** 0.
- **Ready, prioritized issues:**
  - **#161** (`priority:medium`) — `ohtv ask: add prompt-based agent mode alongside existing tools-based one; rename current to --agent-tools`
  - **#162** (`priority:medium`) — Capture `ohtv ask` sessions as on-disk telemetry for cross-mode comparison and replay
  - **#173** (`priority:low`) — refactor: reduce nesting in `_load_engagement_for_ids`
- **On hold:** #26, #90.
- **Selection rule (cached):** #161 and #162 both `priority:medium` → orchestrator picks the **lowest number** per FIFO convention → **#161**. (Also semantically correct: #162 is the telemetry sibling that *depends* on #161's `InvestigationResult` shape, so #161 must land first.)

**Step 4 — Decision (per orchestrate decision tree):**
- **PR slot:** no open PR + ready issues with priorities → **Spawn implementation worker for #161.** ✅
- **Expansion slot:** 0 issues need expansion → **stay idle.** ✅

**Step 5 — Spawned: Implementation Worker**
- Issue: [#161 — `ohtv ask` prompt-based agent mode](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/issues/161) (`priority:medium`)
- Start task: `b284fba4` → `app_conversation_id = 7a6ca22c7e9348b59601808515a56cb0` → **READY** on first poll (~6s warm-picker latency 🔥).
- Conversation: [`7a6ca22`](https://app.all-hands.dev/conversations/7a6ca22c7e9348b59601808515a56cb0)
- Verified `execution_status=running, sandbox_status=RUNNING` immediately after spawn.
- Plugin spec (unchanged, **17th successful spawn**): `{"source": "github:jpshackelford/.openhands", "repo_path": "plugins/ohtv-workflow", "ref": "feat/ohtv-workflow-plugin"}`.
- Spawn payload contract (unchanged, V1): `initial_message: {content: [{type:"text", text:"…"}], run: true}`.
- Auth header: `X-Access-Token: $OPENHANDS_API_KEY`.
- **Prompt scope:** read #161 description + comments → branch from main (latest is `f06f359` on `ohtv-v0.26.0`) → implement two-mode `ohtv ask`: rename current `--agent` to `--agent-tools` (preserve as legacy alias), introduce new prompt-cookbook-based `--agent` → both call into same `InvestigationResult` shape (so #162 telemetry can hook in) → write tests (>80% coverage on new code) → lint/type-check → push as DRAFT PR linking #161 → CI green → flip to ready → `chore(worklog):` WORKLOG update on main → EXIT. **Explicit OUT-OF-SCOPE:** docs spot-check, testing, review (those are separate workers).

**Step 6 — Quiet-cycle check:** Productive cycle (1 worker spawned). Auto-disable counter stays at **0**.

**Cycle expectations for next 1–3 cycles (~30–90 min):**
- **Next cycle (~13:48Z):** Most likely —
  - ~60%: Implementation worker `7a6ca22` still running. `ohtv ask` mode-switching with a new prompt-cookbook scaffold + tests is a ~30–60 min job at typical implementation-worker pace; first cycle after spawn usually finds the worker mid-flight.
  - ~25%: Worker has pushed an initial draft PR; CI may still be running.
  - ~10%: Worker found an architectural snag in the existing `ohtv ask --agent` path (the rename touches `InvestigationResult` callers); may need clarification — would surface as a comment on #161 or a `needs-info` label flip.
  - ~5%: Already in CI-green territory and ready for the docs worker.
- **2 cycles out (~14:18Z):** Likely PR exists, in implementation or CI cleanup phase.
- **3 cycles out (~14:48Z):** Likely CI-green draft → flipped to ready → docs worker dispatched.

**Notes / follow-ups carried forward (cumulative):**
- **`initial_message` spawn-payload contract** stays pinned. **17 successful spawns** in a row with `{"initial_message": {"content": [{"type":"text","text":"…"}], "run": true}}`.
- **Spawn auth header:** `X-Access-Token: $OPENHANDS_API_KEY`.
- **Plugin spec format unchanged.**
- **Start-task POST endpoint:** `POST /api/v1/app-conversations` (singular, NOT `…/start-tasks`).
- **Start-task polling endpoint:** `GET /api/v1/app-conversations/start-tasks/search` — `READY` was reached on first poll this cycle (fastest observed; warm picker).
- **`GH_TOKEN` shim:** `export GH_TOKEN="${GITHUB_TOKEN:-$github_token}"` — worked again.
- **Tool install pattern:** when `.venv/` exists (uv project), prefer `source .venv/bin/activate && uv pip install …` over `pip install --user`. This cycle used the venv path successfully.
- **`uv sync` side effect:** modifies `uv.lock` on a grafted checkout (probably platform-marker churn). Discarded with `git checkout -- uv.lock` — safe because `uv.lock` is regenerated deterministically.
- **PR-review bot:** can emit APPROVED OR COMMENTED-with-tag verdicts; both are merge-ready.
- **Review threads vs PR comments:** `gh pr view --comments` returns issue-style comments only; use GraphQL `reviewThreads` for review threads.
- **Engagement-metric family CLOSED:** 4/4 PRs merged (#172, #174, #175, plus the docs-PR #176). `ohtv-v0.26.0` is the cap-stone release.
- **Next family / cluster:** `ohtv ask` agent-mode family (#161 in flight, #162 depends on it, #173 is an unrelated refactor that can be picked up after).

**Local checkout note:** `main` HEAD at `f06f359` (the merge worker's worklog commit). This entry will commit only WORKLOG.md as `chore(worklog):`. No code branches touched by orchestrator.

EXIT per orchestrate skill — next cycle (~30 min) checks `7a6ca22` (implementation worker) status, looks for a new draft PR linked to #161, and verifies CI state once a PR exists.

### 2026-06-04 17:20 UTC - Orchestrator

**Active Workers:**

| Conv ID | Type | Working On | Status |
|---------|------|------------|--------|
| `5b13c41` | merge | PR #178 — `feat(telemetry): record ohtv ask sessions to ~/.ohtv/telemetry/` (closes #162) | **NEW** (running, verified) |

**Step 0 — Setup:** Reused the workspace clone (already on `main`, clean). Installed `lxa` and `ohtv` via `pip install --user` (the workspace `.venv` from prior cycle didn't exist this time — `uv pip install` fell through to "no virtual environment" so `pip install --user` was the fast path). Both tools landed in `$HOME/.local/bin`. Added `jpshackelford/ohtv` to a fresh lxa board (lxa created its first board on first invocation — cosmetic, ignored). Skipped `ohtv sync` — `gh` covers every gating signal this cycle.

**Step 0.5 — Housekeeping:** WORKLOG.md at **1529 lines** on entry — well over the 300-line threshold. **Skipped truncation this cycle** to keep focus on the merge-ready PR; the orchestrate skill's "older than 6 hours of productive work" archive rule means most legitimate archival targets are pre-11:20Z entries (which exist in bulk). Flagging truncation as the natural next-cycle housekeeping pickup if no spawn-worthy work appears then.

**Step 1 — Human Instructions:** None. `grep "^## INSTRUCTION:" WORKLOG.md` → empty.

**Step 2 — Active Workers (pre-this-spawn):**
- Implementation worker `7a6ca22` (spawned 13:18Z for #161): `execution_status=null, sandbox_status=PAUSED, updated_at=13:48Z` → **finished long ago** (PR #177 already merged + released).
- → **PR slot free**; **expansion slot free**.

**Step 3 — State gathered (the big news: an entire family-arc completed since last orchestrator entry):**
- **Issue #161 — CLOSED** at 15:50:21Z via PR #177 merge. `ohtv-v0.27.0` released. ✅
- **Issue #162 — implementation done**, PR #178 opened at 16:37Z by `feat/issue-162-telemetry` branch (1 commit, `3edcaf9`).
- **PR #178 status (`lxa pr list`):** `oAc green ready` (opened → Approved → commented). 39 min old, last activity 7 min ago.
- **PR #178 deep-dive:**
  - CI: **green**
  - `isDraft: false`
  - `reviewDecision: APPROVED` (review by `github-actions` bot at 16:43:55Z, rating: 🟡 Acceptable — "Well-executed telemetry implementation with solid data structures and comprehensive testing")
  - `mergeable: MERGEABLE`
  - **0 unresolved review threads**
  - **Docs updated:** `docs/reference/telemetry.md` is a new file in the diff (the canonical telemetry reference doc). `AGENTS.md` also touched.
  - **Manual test results posted at 17:10:10Z** by the testing worker — 11 scenarios all PASS plus full unit suite **`2592 passed, 2 skipped, 3 xfailed`**. Tests cover: schema v1 keys + `agent: null` (explicit null, not omission) + filename grammar + `--agent`/`--agent-tools` mode capture + `OHTV_TELEMETRY_DIR` override + `OHTV_TELEMETRY_ENABLED=0` disable + read-only-dir graceful degradation + parallel-invocation `sessions.jsonl` correctness + documented jq one-liner round-trip.
  - **Test freshness:** last code commit at 16:37:06Z, test report at 17:10:10Z — tests are current (33 min gap, no commits since).
- **Open PRs:** 1 (PR #178 — the merge candidate).
- **Issues needing expansion:** 0.
- **Ready, prioritized issues:**
  - **#162** (`priority:medium`) — covered by in-flight PR #178 (will auto-close on merge).
  - **#173** (`priority:low`) — refactor: reduce nesting in `_load_engagement_for_ids`. Next candidate after #178 lands.
- **On hold:** #26, #90.

**Step 4 — Decision (per orchestrate decision tree):**
- **PR slot:** Open PR exists, ready, CI green, **test results valid, good rating, docs valid** → **Spawn merge worker.** ✅
- **Expansion slot:** 0 issues need expansion → **stay idle.** ✅

**Step 5 — Spawned: Merge Worker**
- PR: [#178 — `feat(telemetry): record ohtv ask sessions to ~/.ohtv/telemetry/`](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/pull/178)
- Closes: [#162](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/issues/162)
- Start task: `90229142` → `app_conversation_id = 5b13c41e812d40df8de9d48b13133922` → **READY** on first poll (~5s warm-picker latency 🔥, same fast path as last cycle).
- Conversation: [`5b13c41`](https://app.all-hands.dev/conversations/5b13c41e812d40df8de9d48b13133922)
- Verified `execution_status=running, sandbox_status=RUNNING` immediately after spawn.
- Plugin spec (unchanged, **18th successful spawn**): `{"source": "github:jpshackelford/.openhands", "repo_path": "plugins/ohtv-workflow", "ref": "feat/ohtv-workflow-plugin"}`.
- Spawn payload contract (unchanged, V1): `initial_message: {content: [{type:"text", text:"…"}], run: true}`.
- Auth header: `X-Access-Token: $OPENHANDS_API_KEY`.
- **Prompt scope:** checkout `feat/issue-162-telemetry` → study diff holistically → read manual test report → update PR description to reflect final state (schema v1, env-var overrides, graceful degradation, test coverage) → craft conventional commit subject `feat(telemetry): record ohtv ask sessions to ~/.ohtv/telemetry/` with body + `Closes #162` footer → `gh pr merge 178 --squash --body "$BODY"` → verify merge → `chore(worklog):` WORKLOG update on main → EXIT. **Hard constraints reiterated:** squash-only, no force-push, do not touch `.github/workflows/release.yml` or the `[tool.semantic_release]` block, the auto-generated `chore(release):` commit MUST keep `[skip ci]`.
- **Expected release:** `feat:` subject → **minor bump** `0.27.0 → 0.28.0` via python-semantic-release on push to main. GitHub Release published ~30s after merge.

**Step 6 — Quiet-cycle check:** Productive cycle (1 worker spawned, primary merge action). Auto-disable counter stays at **0**.

**Cycle expectations for next 1–3 cycles (~30–90 min):**
- **Next cycle (~17:50Z):** Most likely —
  - ~75%: Merge worker `5b13c41` has merged PR #178, posted its `chore(worklog):` commit, `ohtv-v0.28.0` tagged on `main`. Slot free. Orchestrator decision: no open PR + only `priority:low` #173 remains → either spawn an implementation worker for #173 or stay idle (priority:low is borderline — last few cycles have always picked it up when nothing else was queued, so probably **spawn impl worker for #173**).
  - ~15%: Merge worker still running (highly unlikely given how mechanical the merge step is, but the release workflow can stall the worker's "verify merge" step occasionally).
  - ~5%: Merge worker hit an unexpected snag (release workflow conflict, branch protection edge case). Would show as a comment on #178 or a `needs-info` flip.
  - ~5%: Truncation-only cycle (no spawn-worthy work, do WORKLOG housekeeping).
- **2 cycles out (~18:20Z):** Likely impl worker on #173 in flight (small refactor, ~30 min job).
- **3 cycles out (~18:50Z):** Likely PR #173-or-equivalent in review/testing phase, or all-quiet if #173 wrapped fast.

**Notes / follow-ups carried forward (cumulative):**
- **`initial_message` spawn-payload contract** stays pinned. **18 successful spawns** in a row with `{"initial_message": {"content": [{"type":"text","text":"…"}], "run": true}}`.
- **Spawn auth header:** `X-Access-Token: $OPENHANDS_API_KEY`.
- **Plugin spec format unchanged.**
- **Start-task POST endpoint:** `POST /api/v1/app-conversations` (singular).
- **Start-task polling endpoint:** `GET /api/v1/app-conversations/start-tasks/search` — `READY` again on first poll (warm-picker latency ~5s; the previous cycle also hit this fast path).
- **`GH_TOKEN` shim:** `export GH_TOKEN="${GITHUB_TOKEN:-$github_token}"` — worked again.
- **Tool install pattern this cycle:** workspace has NO pre-existing venv (the prior cycle's `uv sync` venv didn't carry over). `pip install --user git+https://github.com/jpshackelford/lxa.git git+https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv.git` succeeded → tools in `$HOME/.local/bin` (had to `export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"`). For future cycles: try `uv pip install` first (needs `.venv/`); fall back to `pip install --user` if no venv.
- **`ohtv ask` agent-mode family — almost closed:** #161 ✅ (PR #177 merged, v0.27.0). #162 → PR #178 in **merge slot**. #173 (refactor) is the lone unrelated ready issue queued.
- **PR-review bot:** APPROVED path again this cycle. Body still uses the 🟡 Acceptable rating signal — consistent across last 3 PRs.
- **WORKLOG truncation deferred:** 1529 lines on entry. Next cycle should run truncation (skill: `truncate-worklog`) if it's not spawning a high-priority worker.
- **`docs/reference/telemetry.md`:** new canonical doc landing with #178 — future telemetry-touching PRs should keep this in sync. Worth noting in AGENTS.md after merge if not already (the merge worker's diff review may or may not catch this; flagging here as a follow-up if the AGENTS.md change in #178 doesn't already cover it).

**Local checkout note:** `main` HEAD at `4a25b0b` on entry (`chore(worklog): record PR #178 manual test pass`). This entry commits only WORKLOG.md as `chore(worklog):`. No code branches touched by orchestrator.

EXIT per orchestrate skill — next cycle (~30 min) checks `5b13c41` (merge worker), PR #178 state (expect `merged`), `ohtv-v0.28.0` release on GitHub, and if all green dispatches implementation work for `priority:low` #173 (or stays idle / truncates).

### 2026-06-04 18:20 UTC - Orchestrator

**Active Workers:**

| Conv ID | Type | Working On | Status |
|---------|------|------------|--------|
| `2fc1f83` | testing | PR #179 — refactor: extract `_process_engagement_rows` helper (closes #173) | **NEW** (running, verified) |

**Step 0 — Setup:** Workspace clone at `f06f359` on entry; `git pull` brought it to `4a25b0b` then to the 17:55Z impl-worker WORKLOG commit. `uv venv .venv` + `uv pip install` both `lxa` and `ohtv` into the project venv (system-wide `--system` install still blocked by `/usr/local` perms — same recurring pattern). Skipped `ohtv sync` — `gh` + the start-tasks API covered every gating signal this cycle.

**Step 0.5 — Housekeeping:** WORKLOG.md at **1751 lines** on entry. **7th consecutive cycle** truncation is overdue. The /truncate-worklog skill's 6h-productive-window matcher continues to yield <50 archivable lines (oldest entry now ≈10.5h old; the bulk of pre-15:00Z content sits just outside the rolling window). Same standing recommendation, carried forward yet again: a human `## INSTRUCTION: archive WORKLOG.md entries older than 10h` would unblock ~800 lines in one commit, or a fix to the matcher to be reverse-chrono / wall-clock-aware. **Deferring once more** to keep the focus on the in-flight PR slot dispatch.

**Step 1 — Human Instructions:** None. `awk '/^```/{f=!f;next} !f && /^## INSTRUCTION:/{print}' WORKLOG.md` → empty.

**Step 2 — Active Workers (pre-this-spawn):**
- Implementation worker `871fa09` (spawned 17:48Z for #173): `execution_status=finished, sandbox_status=RUNNING (post-finish lag)`, last update 17:53Z → **finished ✓**. Delivered PR #179 + the 17:55Z self-report on `main` (`refactor/issue-173-engagement-rows` branch, commit `ecf99c7`, +43/−18 LOC in `src/ohtv/cli.py`).
- Merge worker `5b13c41` (spawned 17:20Z for PR #178): `sandbox_status=PAUSED`, last update 17:21:53Z → **finished ✓** (well-confirmed by `ohtv-v0.28.0` release at 17:21Z and `#162` auto-closing on the squash-merge at 17:20:59Z).
- Two unrelated `running` conversations on `repo=null` / `repo=jpshackelford/voice-relay`: `0222e1f` (created 18:15:38Z, no repo — likely a parallel user session) and `7703f83` (created 18:16:04Z, no repo — this is the orchestrator's own conv). Neither is an ohtv worker. ✅ Did NOT collide with the spawn target.
- → **PR slot free**; **expansion slot free**.

**Step 3 — State gathered:**

- **Open PRs:** **1** — PR #179.
- **PR #179 (`refactor: extract _process_engagement_rows helper from _load_engagement_for_ids`):**
  - Branch: `refactor/issue-173-engagement-rows`. Created 17:53:04Z by jpshackelford bot. Diff: 1 file, +43/−18 LOC.
  - `isDraft=false` (ready), `mergeable=MERGEABLE`, `reviewDecision=APPROVED` (the bot approved without leaving threads — clean refactor).
  - **CI:** all 4 checks ✅ — `pytest` (1m14s) · `lint` (4s) · `enable-orchestrator` (4s) · `pr-review` (2m5s).
  - **0 PR comments** → **no manual test results yet** (the 17:55Z impl worker only posted a worklog entry on `main`, not a PR comment).
  - **Docs check:** pure internal refactor — no user-facing surface change (CLI flags, JSON schema, output shape all unchanged). README docs update is **not required** per the orchestrate skill's "Do NOT require docs update if only: internal refactoring" carve-out.
- **Latest release:** `ohtv-v0.28.0` (from PR #178 merge, ~1h ago). The `refactor:` subject on PR #179 will correctly **skip** the release workflow on merge — no version bump, no CHANGELOG entry (intent for an internal refactor; spec'd this way in the 17:48Z entry's impl-worker prompt).
- **Issues needing expansion (no `ready`, no `hold`):** **0**.
- **Ready, prioritized issues remaining:** **0** (#173 is covered by in-flight PR #179; will auto-close on merge).
- **On hold:** #26 (mcp server), #90 (`ohtv label` batch).
- **After PR #179 merges:** Ready queue is fully drained. Next pickup source is expansion of new issues if any get filed.

**Step 4 — Decision (per orchestrate decision tree):**

- **PR slot:** "PR exists, ready, CI green, docs updated (or not required), **no manual test results**" → **Spawn testing worker.** ✅
  - Even though `reviewDecision=APPROVED`, the orchestrator workflow contract requires a `## Manual Test Results` comment on the PR before merge. The approve happened without inline threads, but the test gate is independent.
- **Expansion slot:** 0 issues need expansion → **stay idle.** ✅

**Step 5 — Spawned: Testing Worker**

- PR: [#179 — refactor: extract `_process_engagement_rows` helper from `_load_engagement_for_ids`](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/pull/179) (`Closes #173`)
- Start task: `df19b78f` → `app_conversation_id = 2fc1f83dc9e64fcebbf75b34ad5a7db7` → **READY** on the 1st poll (~5s; warm-picker, same fast path as the last 5 spawns).
- Conversation: [`2fc1f83`](https://app.all-hands.dev/conversations/2fc1f83dc9e64fcebbf75b34ad5a7db7)
- Verified `execution_status=running, sandbox_status=RUNNING` immediately after spawn.
- Plugin spec (unchanged, **25th successful spawn** in a row): `{"source": "github:jpshackelford/.openhands", "repo_path": "plugins/ohtv-workflow", "ref": "feat/ohtv-workflow-plugin"}`.
- Spawn payload contract (unchanged, V1): `initial_message: {content: [{type:"text", text:"…"}], run: true}`.
- Auth header: `X-Access-Token: $OPENHANDS_API_KEY`.
- **Prompt scope:** `gh pr checkout 179` → `uv sync` → exercise `ohtv list --engagement` on a real DB (the impl worker tested this path with 86 unit tests but the blackbox check is the gate) → exercise both `ohtv list` and `ohtv gen objs` engagement code paths → if available, pick a >900-id set spanning the BATCH_SIZE chunk boundary (else document the limitation) → verify dashed ↔ dashless ID translation (AGENTS.md item #14) → full `uv run pytest -q` with focus on the 86 engagement tests + `test_chunk_query_count` (1100-ids ⇒ two-SELECTs invariant) → post `## Manual Test Results` PR comment → EXIT. **Explicit no-go:** no `gh pr merge`, no `gh pr ready --undo`, no `chore(worklog):` on `main` until the comment is posted.

**Step 6 — Quiet-cycle check:** Productive cycle (1 worker spawned). Auto-disable counter stays at **0**.

**Cycle expectations for next 1–3 cycles (~30–90 min):**

- **Next cycle (~18:50Z):** Most likely —
  - ~65%: Testing worker `2fc1f83` has finished, posted `## Manual Test Results` ✅ PASS on PR #179. Code freshness invariant holds (no commits since 17:53Z impl). Orchestrator's decision tree lands on "PR exists, ready, CI green, test results valid, good rating, **docs valid (not required)**" → **spawn merge worker.** Direct route to merge; no review round expected since the bot already approved without threads.
  - ~25%: Testing worker still running (the refactor needs no test fix-ups, but warm-up + 2592-test suite run is ~48s plus the blackbox exercises).
  - ~5%: Testing worker discovered a regression (extremely unlikely given the impl worker's pre-push verification — 86 engagement tests + full suite green before push). Would post a ❌ FAIL report; orchestrator routes to a review-round worker.
  - ~5%: Truncation-only cycle if all the above stall.
- **2 cycles out (~19:20Z):** Likely PR #179 merged + worklog entry on `main`. **First all-quiet cycle** of the new idle phase (no ready issues, no PRs in flight). Auto-disable counter → 1.
- **3 cycles out (~19:50Z):** **Second consecutive all-quiet cycle** → **automation auto-disables** per the orchestrate skill's auto-disable rule (counter ≥ 2). The cron stops until a human re-enables it (e.g. by filing a new issue + manual re-enable, or by adding new `## INSTRUCTION:` items).

**Notes / follow-ups carried forward (cumulative):**

- **`initial_message` spawn-payload contract** stays pinned. **25 successful spawns** in a row with `{"initial_message": {"content": [{"type":"text","text":"…"}], "run": true}}`.
- **Spawn auth header:** `X-Access-Token: $OPENHANDS_API_KEY` (header name; no `Bearer` prefix).
- **Plugin spec format unchanged.**
- **Start-task POST endpoint:** `POST /api/v1/app-conversations`. Polling: `GET /api/v1/app-conversations/start-tasks/search` (warm-picker again — `READY` on first 5s poll for the 6th cycle running).
- **`GH_TOKEN` shim:** `export GH_TOKEN="${GITHUB_TOKEN:-$github_token}"` — worked again.
- **Tool install pattern this cycle:** workspace had NO `.venv` pre-existing. `uv venv .venv` + `uv pip install git+…/lxa.git git+…/ohtv.git` succeeded into `.venv/bin/`. System-wide `uv pip install --system` blocked by `/usr/local/lib/python3.13/site-packages` perms (known).
- **PR-review bot verdict trend:** Three PRs in a row (#175 / #178 / #179) → `reviewDecision=APPROVED`. The COMMENTED+🟢-tag fallback path may now be dead. Worth tracking for one more cycle to be sure.
- **Workflow approaching idle:** With #173 in flight as PR #179, the ready queue empties on merge. Auto-disable likely fires at ~19:50Z if no new issues file.
- **WORKLOG truncation:** 7 consecutive cycles overdue. Standing recommendation unchanged: human `## INSTRUCTION: archive WORKLOG.md entries older than 10h`.
- **Spawn-conversation contract quirk:** single-conversation GET (`/api/v1/app-conversations/{id}`) returned an empty body this cycle (could be a transient API hiccup or that endpoint was never wired); the search endpoint with `select(.id == "...")` worked fine as a fallback. Pinning the search-based verification for future cycles.
- **Refactor-only PR routing observation:** PR #179 is the first `refactor:` PR in a while where the bot approved without threads AND no docs touch is required. This is the cleanest path through the decision tree the orchestrator has seen — impl → ✅ test → merge (3 cycles, no review round). Worth noting as a baseline for future internal-refactor work.

**Local checkout note:** `main` HEAD on entry at `4a25b0b` then pulled to the 17:55Z impl-worker WORKLOG commit. This entry commits only WORKLOG.md as `chore(worklog):`. No code branches touched by orchestrator.

EXIT per orchestrate skill — next cycle (~30 min) checks `2fc1f83` (testing worker), looks for a `## Manual Test Results` comment on PR #179, and (if pass + no new code commits between test and now) dispatches the merge worker. After PR #179 lands the queue empties; auto-disable approaches.

### 2026-06-04 18:52 UTC - Merge Worker (PR #179)

**Worker Type:** `merge`
**PR:** [#179 — `refactor: extract _process_engagement_rows helper from _load_engagement_for_ids`](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/pull/179)
**Issue:** [#173 — `refactor: reduce nesting in _load_engagement_for_ids`](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/issues/173)
**Status:** ✅ **MERGED**

**Merge details:**

- Squash-merge commit: [`fa4056d`](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/commit/fa4056d92304bf739f581e750f2b43b18613026b) on `main` at 2026-06-04T18:50:46Z.
- Subject: `refactor: extract _process_engagement_rows helper from _load_engagement_for_ids` (PR title used verbatim — valid conventional-commit subject).
- Body references #173 and the load-bearing `test_chunk_query_count` invariant (1100 ids → 2 SELECTs across the `BATCH_SIZE=900` chunk boundary).
- Issue #173 **auto-closed** at 2026-06-04T18:50:48Z via the `Closes #173` footer.
- PR description was refreshed before merge to consolidate the manual-test summary + load-bearing test mention + invariants list.

**Release workflow correctly no-op'd:**

- Run [`26972604387`](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/actions/runs/26972604387) on the merge commit completed in 1m3s.
- `release` job ✓ green; `Publish GitHub Release` step **skipped** (no version bump triggered).
- Latest tag remains `ohtv-v0.28.0` at `abda5b6` (pre-merge). **No `ohtv-v0.28.1` / `ohtv-v0.29.0` tag created.**
- No `chore(release): ohtv X.Y.Z [skip ci]` commit appended to `main`.
- This matches the AGENTS.md release contract: `refactor:` subjects bump nothing and produce no CHANGELOG entry.

**Merge criteria confirmation (all met before merge):**

- CI green (pytest, lint, enable-orchestrator, pr-review). Last commit `ecf99c7` at 17:51:54Z.
- Review APPROVED by the pr-review bot, no inline threads (3rd consecutive `APPROVED` verdict — #175 / #178 / #179).
- Manual test results posted at 18:27:42Z by `2fc1f83` (testing worker), 12/12 PASS including `test_chunk_query_count`.
- No new commits between manual-test post and merge (freshness invariant held).
- Pure internal refactor — README update correctly skipped per the `orchestrate` skill "internal refactoring" carve-out.
- Mergeable: `MERGEABLE`, not draft, ready.

**Diff scope (final):**

- 1 file (`src/ohtv/cli.py`), +43 / -18 LOC.
- New helper `_process_engagement_rows(rows, normalized_to_original, engagement_map) -> None` lifted from the chunk loop.
- `typing.Any` and `typing.Iterable` added to the existing `from typing import …` line.
- Nested-block depth inside `_load_engagement_for_ids` reduced from 5 → 3 (outer `try` → `with` → `for chunk`).

**Notes for orchestrator's next cycle (~19:20Z):**

- Ready queue empties with PR #179 merged. No open PRs. No open issues with `ready` label (modulo whatever orchestrator finds on next wake).
- **First all-quiet cycle** of this idle phase is likely at ~19:20Z; **auto-disable counter → 1**. If the next-next cycle (~19:50Z) is also quiet, auto-disable fires.
- The "refactor-only PR → impl → ✅ test → merge in 3 cycles, no review round" pattern observed last cycle is now confirmed: PR #179 followed exactly that path, end-to-end ~1h05m wall-clock from impl spawn to merge.

**Files touched by this worker:**

- `WORKLOG.md` only (this entry). Commit subject `chore(worklog): …` so the release workflow ignores it (no version bump from a worklog commit).
- No code, no `pyproject.toml`, no `src/ohtv/__init__.py`, no `CHANGELOG.md` — semantic-release owns those and `refactor:` correctly skipped them.

### 2026-06-04 21:21 UTC - Orchestrator

**Step 0 — Setup:** workspace had NO `.venv` pre-existing. `uv venv .venv` + `uv pip install git+…/lxa.git git+…/ohtv.git` succeeded into the project-local venv (system-wide `--system` still blocked by `/usr/local/lib/python3.13/site-packages` perms — known). `ohtv sync --since $(date -u -d '4 hours ago' …)` clean (no errors, no output).

**Step 0.5 — Housekeeping:** WORKLOG.md at **2256 lines** on entry. **10th consecutive cycle** truncation is overdue. Same standing recommendation: human `## INSTRUCTION: archive WORKLOG.md entries older than 10h` (or a fix to the matcher to be reverse-chrono / wall-clock-aware). **Deferring once more** — the PR slot has actionable work.

**Step 1 — Human Instructions:** None. `awk '/^```/{f=!f;next} !f && /^## INSTRUCTION:/{print}' WORKLOG.md` → empty.

**Step 2 — Active Workers (pre-this-spawn):** Polled `app-conversations/search?limit=30`:
- Testing worker `66a5602` (spawned 20:35Z for PR #182): `execution_status=finished, sandbox_status=RUNNING (post-finish lag)`, last update 21:08Z → **finished ✓**. Delivered the 21:06:57Z `## Manual Test Results` comment on PR #182 (12/12 PASS + 2614 unit tests).
- Docs worker `dc8bcb3` (20:27Z): `sandbox=PAUSED` → ignored.
- `761a275` ("Review PR #14650"): different repo (OpenHands core), not an ohtv worker.
- → **PR slot free**; **expansion slot free**.

**Step 3 — Gather State:**

- **Open PRs:** [PR #182](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/pull/182) — `feat(filter): add --event-dates to filter by engagement timestamps`. `lxa` history: `oAFc` (opened → Approved → Fixes pushed → comment-on-changes-since-approval). CI **green** (lint-pr-title ✓ 4s, tests/pytest ✓ 1m16s). `reviewDecision=APPROVED`. `mergeable=MERGEABLE`. Last commit `58fa6a5` at 20:25:46Z (the docs commit). Two PR-level comments: 20:27:36Z docs-update notice + 21:06:57Z manual test results. **1 unresolved review thread** (`PRRT_kwDOR9seq86HL6-x`) from the pr-review bot: a 🟡 suggestion to collapse `if has_date_filter or use_event_dates:` → `if has_date_filter:` since `use_event_dates = event_dates AND has_date_filter` makes the disjunction redundant.
- **Issues needing expansion:** none. (Last cycle's prediction of an idle queue was wrong — issues #180 and #181 were filed during the gap; both are now `ready`.)
- **Ready issues:** [#180](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/issues/180) `priority:high` (already in flight as PR #182), [#181](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/issues/181) `ready` (no priority on entry).
- **WORKLOG gap (18:52Z → now):** five worker conversations ran without orchestrator entries (impl `417d897`/`1498695` for #180/#181, docs `dc8bcb3`, testing `66a5602`, and one more I haven't unpacked). Same gap pattern flagged last cycle for PR #179. Carrying forward as a soft observation.

**Step 4 — Decision Tree:**

- **Expansion slot:** no issues need expansion → idle.
- **PR slot:** PR #182 is ready, CI green, docs ✓, test results valid + fresh (test posted 21:06Z, no commits after 20:25Z), **💬=1** unresolved suggestion thread → branch `PR exists, ready, CI green, test results valid, 💬 > 0 → spawn review worker` per the orchestrate skill decision tree. The suggestion is a 1-line redundancy removal; review worker can address + resolve thread + flip back to ready in a single cycle.

**Step 5 — `/assess-priority` inline for #181:**

- **Verdict: `priority:medium`** — applied to #181 via `gh issue edit 181 --add-label priority:medium`.
- **Rationale:** Quality-of-life CLI addition (`ohtv messages` to list user messages across conversations). Not a bug, not blocking other work, fully additive. Expansion worker for #180 already noted #181 is "queued behind" #180. Not `priority:high` because no downstream dependency or user-facing bug is being unblocked. Not `priority:low` because it has clear user value and a well-scoped technical plan in the issue body.

**Step 6 — Spawn: Review Worker**

| Conv ID | Type | Working On | Status |

| `865253a` | review | PR #182 round 1 (`--event-dates` JOIN condition cleanup) | **NEW** |

- **Conversation:** [`865253a`](https://app.all-hands.dev/conversations/865253adf6164a16953bf1a442c05238) (full ID `865253adf6164a16953bf1a442c05238`).
- **Start-task ID:** `55c058adc4b64e8bbda0e64900ae53f1` — `READY` on 1st poll (~12s after POST), 9-cycle warm-picker streak holds.
- Verified `execution_status=running, sandbox_status=RUNNING` immediately after READY.
- Plugin spec (unchanged, **29th successful spawn** in a row): `{"source": "github:jpshackelford/.openhands", "repo_path": "plugins/ohtv-workflow", "ref": "feat/ohtv-workflow-plugin"}`.
- Auth header: `X-Access-Token: $OPENHANDS_API_KEY`.
- **Prompt scope:**
  1. Clone repo + `gh pr checkout 182` + `uv sync`.
  2. `gh pr ready 182 --undo` (back to draft per the review-worker pattern).
  3. Locate `use_event_dates = event_dates and has_date_filter` (likely in `src/ohtv/db/stores/conversation_store.py` or `src/ohtv/cli.py`); collapse the call-site disjunction `if has_date_filter or use_event_dates:` → `if has_date_filter:`.
  4. Run `uv run pytest -q` — expect the 2614/2/3 baseline from the testing worker's report.
  5. Commit with `refactor: simplify date-filter JOIN condition per review`; push to `feat/event-dates-filter-180`; wait for CI green via `gh pr checks 182 --watch`.
  6. Reply to thread `PRRT_kwDOR9seq86HL6-x` via `addPullRequestReviewThreadReply` with the commit SHA, then `resolveReviewThread`.
  7. `gh pr ready 182` (flip back from draft → ready, triggers pr-review bot).
  8. Append `### YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM UTC - Review Worker (PR #182, round 1)` to `WORKLOG.md` on `main` with `chore(worklog):` subject + AI-disclosure footer.
- **Guardrails:** no docs touch (README is correct), no new tests (existing suite covers the JOIN behavior), do NOT create a new PR, do NOT change PR title, diff should be ~1 line.

**Cycle expectations for next 1–3 cycles (~30–90 min):**

- **Next cycle (~21:50Z):** Most likely —
  - ~70%: Review worker `865253a` complete, thread resolved + 1-line commit pushed + CI green + PR back to ready. Orchestrator decision: docs ✓ (already done), test results were **before** the new commit so re-test logic kicks in — but the new commit is a 1-line refactor (NOT in the `*.py source files changed except tests` heuristic that triggers re-test). Per the orchestrate skill: "Do NOT re-test if only: Type hints added (no runtime effect)" — a redundancy-only refactor of an identical boolean condition belongs in the same category. → Spawn **merge worker** for PR #182.
  - ~20%: Review worker still running (1-line fixes can stall on CI watch). Quiet entry; PR slot blocked.
  - ~7%: Review worker decided the suggestion shouldn't be applied (extremely unlikely — it's a clean dead-code removal with the bot's own explicit `suggestion` block) → posts a justification, resolves the thread, flips ready. Then merge worker.
  - ~3%: Re-test heuristic interpreted strictly because `cli.py` changed → testing worker re-runs. Adds 1 cycle. Same merge endpoint.
- **2 cycles out (~22:20Z):** Likely PR #182 merged + `ohtv-v0.29.0` released (semantic-release picks up the `feat(filter):` subject → **minor bump**), and orchestrator picks up #181 next: spawn **implementation worker** for #181 (now `priority:medium`, no other ready issues). README + 1 new command (`ohtv messages`) means full pipeline (impl → docs → test → review → merge).
- **3 cycles out (~22:50Z):** Likely #181 implementation worker still running (new command + tests typically 30–60 min); orchestrator quiet on PR slot but expansion slot has nothing to expand.

**Notes / follow-ups carried forward (cumulative):**

- **`initial_message` spawn-payload contract** stays pinned. **29 successful spawns** in a row with `{"initial_message": {"content": [{"type":"text","text":"…"}], "run": true}}`.
- **Spawn auth header:** `X-Access-Token: $OPENHANDS_API_KEY` (header name; no `Bearer` prefix).
- **Plugin spec format unchanged:** `{"source": "github:jpshackelford/.openhands", "repo_path": "plugins/ohtv-workflow", "ref": "feat/ohtv-workflow-plugin"}`.
- **Start-task POST endpoint:** `POST /api/v1/app-conversations`. Polling: `GET /api/v1/app-conversations/start-tasks/search`. READY on 1st poll (**9 cycles** running).
- **`GH_TOKEN` shim:** `export GH_TOKEN="${GITHUB_TOKEN:-$github_token}"` — worked again.
- **Tool install pattern stays project-local:** `.venv/bin/{ohtv,lxa}`; system-wide `--system` install still blocked by `/usr/local/lib/python3.13/site-packages` perms.
- **PR-review bot streak update:** **4 APPROVED-without-thread-comments in a row** broken this cycle — PR #182 got APPROVED **with** a 🟡 inline suggestion (the `or use_event_dates` redundancy). The 5th APPROVED verdict in a row (still `reviewDecision=APPROVED`), but the bot is back to leaving non-blocking suggestions. The COMMENTED+🟢-tag fallback path stays defensive for one more cycle.
- **Single-conversation GET endpoint glitch carried forward** — search-based verification still the working pattern.
- **`/assess-priority` inline path validated again:** quality-of-life CLI addition + no downstream dependency → `priority:medium`. Recorded explicit rationale in the prior section.
- **WORKLOG truncation:** 10 consecutive cycles overdue. Standing recommendation unchanged.

**Local checkout note:** `main` HEAD on entry at `6d034ac` (testing worker's worklog commit). This entry commits only `WORKLOG.md` as `chore(worklog):`. No code branches touched by orchestrator.

EXIT per orchestrate skill — next cycle (~30 min) checks `865253a` status, looks for the thread-resolved state on PR #182 + a `refactor:` commit pushed to `feat/event-dates-filter-180`, and (if ready + CI green) dispatches the merge worker.

## 2026-06-04T21:54Z — merge worker — PR #182 squash-merged (Issue #180 closed, release tag `ohtv-v0.29.0`)

**Outcome: PR #182 merged → Issue #180 CLOSED → release `ohtv-v0.29.0` published.**

| Action | Result |
|---|---|
| Squash merge via `gh pr merge 182 --squash` | ✓ commit `9cdbbe2efa734a1d28a595f9aa4d4f7a463ce5ae` on `main` |
| Auto-close of linked issue | ✓ Issue #180 → `state: CLOSED`, `closedAt: 2026-06-04T21:52:32Z` |
| `python-semantic-release` workflow on `main` | ✓ Run `26981820835` succeeded in 1m10s |
| Auto-generated release commit | `61c47ae chore(release): ohtv 0.29.0 [skip ci]` |
| New release tag | `ohtv-v0.29.0` (minor bump from `ohtv-v0.28.0`, as expected for `feat(filter):`) |
| GitHub Release | ✓ Published `less than a minute ago` per `gh release list` |

**Squash subject preserved verbatim per release contract:** `feat(filter): add --event-dates to filter by engagement timestamps`. Body cites `Closes #180`, the threading scope (6 commands + `refs` excluded), migration 024, AC1–AC6 verification, testing worker `66a5602` READY FOR MERGE verdict, and the standard `Co-authored-by: openhands <openhands@all-hands.dev>` trailer.

**No description rewrite needed** — pre-merge PR body already accurately described post-review-round-1 state (single SQL owner, INNER JOIN semantics, migration 024, 22 new tests, AC1–AC7), and `Fixes #180` was present from the original push.

**PR slot now free for next orchestrator cycle to spawn an implementation worker for Issue #181 (`priority:medium`, `ready`)** — the engagement-grouping rollup explicitly builds on `ConversationStore.list_by_event_date_range` (the SQL owner that landed in this PR), so #181 should be a thin extension rather than a parallel SQL implementation.

**Release-workflow note:** Single deprecation annotation on the release run (`actions/checkout@v4` on Node 20 — non-blocking; tracked separately upstream). No errors. Run URL: https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/actions/runs/26981820835.

**Local checkout note:** `main` HEAD on entry at `66e3425`, advanced via fast-forward to `61c47ae` (post-release commit). This entry commits only `WORKLOG.md` as `chore(worklog):` so the release workflow ignores it (per AGENTS.md release contract).

### 2026-06-04 22:21 UTC - Orchestrator

**Step 0 — Setup:** workspace had NO `.venv` pre-existing. `uv venv .venv` + `uv pip install git+…/lxa.git git+…/ohtv.git` succeeded into the project-local venv. `ohtv sync --since 4h` clean. (System-wide `--system` install still blocked by `/usr/local/lib/python3.13/site-packages` perms — known.)

**Step 0.5 — Housekeeping:** WORKLOG.md at **2473 lines** on entry. **11th consecutive cycle** truncation is overdue. Same standing recommendation: human `## INSTRUCTION: archive WORKLOG.md entries older than 10h`. **Deferring once more** — PR slot has actionable work this cycle.

**Step 1 — Human Instructions:** None. `grep "^## INSTRUCTION:" WORKLOG.md` → empty.

**Step 2 — Active Workers (pre-this-spawn):** Polled `app-conversations/search?limit=30` filtered to running+RUNNING:

- `55f3bef` — bare-id title (`Conversation 55f3bef…`) → **this orchestrator conversation itself**, ignored.
- `9dfbd1e` — `👔 Review PR #14650 Comments by jpshackelford` → OpenHands core repo, not ohtv. Ignored.
- → **PR slot free**; **expansion slot free**.

**Step 3 — Gather State:**

- **Open PRs:** none. PR #182 (`feat(filter): add --event-dates`) was squash-merged at 21:52:32Z (commit `9cdbbe2`); Issue #180 auto-closed; release `ohtv-v0.29.0` published (run `26981820835`).
- **Issues needing expansion:** none. The two unlabelled-as-ready issues (`#26` mcp-server, `#90` `ohtv label`) carry the `hold` label and are skipped per the decision tree.
- **Ready issues:** **[#181](https://github.com/jpshackelford/ohtv/issues/181)** — `ready` + `priority:medium`. Dependency `#180` is now MERGED (`9cdbbe2` on `main`), so `ConversationStore.list_by_event_date_range` is available as the SQL owner. Technical-Approach comment from @jpshackelford at 19:55Z proposes `src/ohtv/messages.py` as a sibling of `errors.py` / `actions.py`.

**Step 4 — Decision Tree:**

- **Expansion slot:** no issues need expansion → idle.
- **PR slot:** no open PR + ready issues with priority → `Ready issues exist? YES → Prioritized? YES → Spawn impl (highest prio)`. Only one ready issue (#181, `priority:medium`) — spawn implementation worker for it.

**Step 5 — Spawn: Implementation Worker**

| Conv ID | Type | Working On | Status |
|---------|------|------------|--------|
| `b68bb0d` | implementation | Issue #181 — `ohtv messages` command | **NEW** |

- **Conversation:** [`b68bb0d`](https://app.all-hands.dev/conversations/b68bb0de90434480abfcf8914363b57f) (full id `b68bb0de90434480abfcf8914363b57f`).
- **Start-task ID:** `61623d00b13b4cb899c9be5b34551646` — `READY` on 1st poll (~5s after POST), **10-cycle warm-picker streak holds**.
- Verified `execution_status=running, sandbox_status=RUNNING` immediately after READY.
- Plugin spec (unchanged, **30th successful spawn** in a row): `{"source": "github:jpshackelford/.openhands", "repo_path": "plugins/ohtv-workflow", "ref": "feat/ohtv-workflow-plugin"}`.
- Auth header: `X-Access-Token: $OPENHANDS_API_KEY`.
- **Prompt scope:**
  1. Read issue #181 body + technical-approach comment as the dual contract.
  2. Skim AGENTS.md items #14 (ID normalization), #32 (root-conversation grain), #35 (`--event-dates` predicate ownership — `list_by_event_date_range` is THE single SQL owner; do NOT duplicate the engagement-table JOIN).
  3. Branch: `feat/messages-command-181` off `main` (which now has #180 merged).
  4. Create `src/ohtv/messages.py` (sibling of `errors.py` / `actions.py` / `fetch_loc.py`) — `UserMessage` dataclass, message extraction, on-demand event loading from disk, 500-char truncation. Wire `ohtv messages` Click command in `cli.py` with the full flag set per the AC table (`--since/-S`, `--until/-U`, `--day/-D`, `--week/-W`, `--max/-n` default 10, `--all/-A`, `--offset/-k`, `--format/-F` text|json|raw, `-1` raw shorthand, `--full`, `--source`, `--repo`, `--label/-L`, `--include-sub-conversations`).
  5. Default pagination: 10 conversations; pagination is BY CONVERSATION not message; within a shown conversation ALL matching user messages render.
  6. Tests under `tests/unit/test_messages.py` + `tests/unit/test_cli_messages.py` (target >80% on new code; build in-memory SQLite DB via `get_ready_connection()` — DO NOT mock `list_by_event_date_range`).
  7. `uv run pytest -q` → expect ~2614 baseline + new tests.
  8. PR title: `feat(cli): add ohtv messages command to list user messages across conversations` (squash subject; triggers minor bump per AGENTS.md release contract — anticipated next release: `ohtv-v0.30.0`).
  9. DRAFT PR → `gh pr checks --watch` → green → `gh pr ready` (triggers pr-review bot).
  10. Append `### YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM UTC - Implementation Worker (Issue #181)` to WORKLOG.md on `main` with `chore(worklog):` subject + AI-disclosure footer.
- **Guardrails:** no docs touch (README is the docs worker's job AFTER `gh pr ready`); no `pyproject.toml` / `src/ohtv/__init__.py` / `CHANGELOG.md` (semantic-release owns those); reuse existing `_parse_date_filters` + `_apply_conversation_filters`; default `--include-sub-conversations=False` per #127 plumbing; PR title MUST match `feat(cli):` (or `feat:`) for the conventional-commits gate.

**Step 6 — Quiet-cycle check:** Productive cycle (1 worker spawned, no quiet entry). Auto-disable counter stays at **0**.

**Cycle expectations for next 1–3 cycles (~30–90 min):**

- **Next cycle (~22:50Z):** Most likely —
  - ~65%: Impl worker `b68bb0d` still running. Implementation + tests + CI watch typically 30–60 min for a new top-level command with ~20 unit tests + ~10 CLI tests. Quiet entry; PR slot occupied.
  - ~25%: Impl worker has pushed a DRAFT PR (numbered `#183` by sequence) and is mid-CI-watch. Orchestrator sees a draft PR + running worker → quiet entry.
  - ~7%: Impl worker has flipped to ready already. Orchestrator's decision tree: `PR exists, ready, CI green, README not updated → spawn docs worker`. The new `ohtv messages` command is a user-facing addition, so docs MUST update before testing per the orchestrate skill's "Test What's Documented" principle.
  - ~3%: Impl worker hit a wall on the event-loading code (events are on-disk per AGENTS.md item #12 separation) — would post a blocker comment on #181 and exit. Orchestrator would re-spawn or back off.
- **2 cycles out (~23:20Z):** Likely a draft PR exists; impl worker finishing tests + CI. If lucky, ready PR + docs worker spawned.
- **3 cycles out (~23:50Z):** Likely docs worker complete → testing worker. End-to-end timeline to merge: typical 4–6 cycles for a new top-level command with this much surface area.

**Notes / follow-ups carried forward (cumulative):**

- **`initial_message` spawn-payload contract** stays pinned. **30 successful spawns** in a row with `{"initial_message": {"content": [{"type":"text","text":"…"}], "run": true}}`.
- **Spawn auth header:** `X-Access-Token: $OPENHANDS_API_KEY` (header name; no `Bearer` prefix).
- **Plugin spec format unchanged.**
- **Start-task POST endpoint:** `POST /api/v1/app-conversations`. Polling: `GET /api/v1/app-conversations/start-tasks/search`. **READY on 1st poll for 10 cycles running.**
- **`GH_TOKEN` shim:** `export GH_TOKEN="${GITHUB_TOKEN:-$github_token}"` — worked again.
- **Tool install pattern stays project-local:** `.venv/bin/{ohtv,lxa}`; system-wide `--system` install still blocked.
- **PR-review bot streak update:** PR #182 closed with APPROVED + 1 inline suggestion (the redundant disjunction collapsed in round 1). 5th consecutive APPROVED verdict on the bot. Defensive COMMENTED+🟢-tag fallback path stays one more cycle.
- **WORKLOG truncation:** **11 consecutive cycles overdue.** Standing recommendation unchanged.
- **#181 unlocks cleanly:** The `#180 → #181` dependency chain is the first the orchestrator has seen where the unblocking PR landed in the same cycle session as the dependent issue's impl spawn. Worth noting as a baseline for future dependency chains. The technical-approach comment correctly identified `list_by_event_date_range` (the #180 SQL owner) as the call surface — no design coordination needed across the boundary.
- **Idle queue context:** After #181 ships, only `hold`-labeled issues remain (#26 mcp-server, #90 `ohtv label`). The auto-disable horizon shifts out to whenever #181 merges + 2 consecutive quiet cycles thereafter.

**Local checkout note:** `main` HEAD on entry at `52facbd` (last cycle's merge-worker worklog commit). This entry commits only WORKLOG.md as `chore(worklog):`. No code branches touched by orchestrator.

EXIT per orchestrate skill — next cycle (~30 min) checks `b68bb0d` status, looks for a draft PR on `feat/messages-command-181`, and routes through the docs → test → review → merge pipeline as #181 progresses.
